# Roadmap

This file is the project backlog — ideas that need team discussion
before becoming a spec.

## Two valid entry paths

1. **Roadmap-first** — for ideas that benefit from async brainstorm
   or team validation. Run `/octopus:doc-research <slug>` to produce
   a research doc + new RM entry. The RM graduates to a Spec or RFC
   when work begins; when that happens, update the item's status to
   "in progress" and link the new document.

2. **Spec-first** — for work that already came out of a synchronous
   brainstorm (e.g. the `superpowers:brainstorming` skill) with a
   clear rationale and scope. Create the spec directly via
   `/octopus:doc-spec <slug>` — no RM needed. The spec itself
   carries the "why" and links from the CHANGELOG entry keep the
   history visible.

Use spec-first when the brainstorm already happened; use
roadmap-first when the idea still needs shaping.

#### Parked (Tier B) — not roadmapped

- **LSP integration** — the article calls out language-server
  symbol navigation as a critical practice for typed languages.
  High value, high effort (probably needs an MCP server wrapping
  language servers per stack). **Acknowledged but not roadmapped**
  pending explicit demand. When demand arrives, open as a
  dedicated planning round.
- **`.claudeignore` template** — small surface; `permissions.deny`
  in settings covers most cases today. Revisit if a user reports
  the gap.
- **Per-subdirectory test/lint commands** — `auto-format.sh`
  already scopes by file path; full-suite test timeouts haven't
  been reported. Revisit if monorepos start hitting it.

### Cluster 16 — Manager multiplier / engineering leadership

_**Complete on `feat/standards-lookup`** — all of RM-089…096 + RM-098 implemented and committed (pending merge/release). Seeds from [research](research/2026-05-30-manager-multiplier.md): extend Octopus so a tech manager can standardize and raise the team's bar across 6+ repos without being the bottleneck._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-089 | `mentor` role — coaching review persona that teaches the *why* | pedagogy |
| RM-090 | `onboarding` skill — ramp a new engineer onto standards + codebase + workflow | pedagogy |
| RM-091 | `definition-of-done` skill + artifact — first-class team DoD | pedagogy |
| RM-092 | `standards` self-serve lookup — "what's our standard for X / why" | pedagogy |
| RM-093 | Team-level `continuous-learning` — recurring PR feedback → rule candidates | knowledge loop |
| RM-094 | `audit-fleet` — cross-repo adoption + drift audit | cross-repo |
| RM-095 | Fleet bootstrap — bulk-apply a standard `.octopus.yml` across repos | cross-repo |
| RM-096 | `tech-lead` bundle — composes the manager kit | bundle |
| RM-098 | `map-system --save` — themed self-contained HTML deck of the repo (overview, business insights, diagrams, API contracts) via frontend-design + launch-release themes; RM-090 depends on it | pedagogy |

---

### Cluster 17 — Consigliere / manager knowledge workspace

_All items **proposed** (added 2026-05-31). Seeds from [research](research/2026-05-31-consigliere-workspace.md): a private `manager-workspace` where a manager digests diverse inputs (Slack, Meet transcripts, Jira, Confluence) into living, grounded memory organized by perennial **contexts** (tree) and cross-cutting **projects**. Where Cluster 16 multiplies the **team**, Cluster 17 multiplies the **manager themselves** — a personal chief-of-staff (`consigliere`). Reuses `audit-grounding` (RM-088) for strict grounding and the continuous-learning pattern for the heuristics loop. Build order: RM-099 → RM-100/101 → RM-102/103; RM-104 is an independent enabler._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-099 | `consigliere` workspace scaffold + bundle — `manager-workspace` layout (sources/contexts/projects/people), `state/journal/playbook` trio convention, `meta.yml` schema, operating README, bundle registration | foundation |
| RM-100 | `digest-source` skill — multi-modal capture (text/PDF/Jira) → immutable snapshot in `sources/` → infer→confirm→preview→write with fan-out pointers; grounded 6-field extraction (status, blockers+owner, decisions, system map, actions+owners, political risk) reusing `audit-grounding` | capture |
| RM-101 | `consigliere` role — the lens/voice: political-risk reading, push/pull application of the playbook, "thinks like you"; the fundamental piece | role |
| RM-102 | `context-status` skill — natural-language consult over materialized state ("how's payments? what's blocked?") | consult |
| RM-103 | `playbook-review` skill + learning loop — seed + capture heuristics from digests, promote to `playbook.md` (reuses continuous-learning / review-proposals) | knowledge loop |
| RM-104 | Atlassian MCP integration — Confluence read + richer Jira; fallback export-PDF until present | integration |

_The workspace's proactive / cross-node / maintenance layer is **not** consigliere-specific — those are operations over any linked markdown tree. They live in **Cluster 19** (knowledge-root operations); the consigliere is one registered root + lens profile (RM-110)._

_Architecture decisions: artifacts generic-in-Octopus + data-in-private-workspace ([ADR-007](adr/007-consigliere-artifact-location.md)); `consigliere` as a separate bundle ([ADR-008](adr/008-consigliere-bundle-separation.md)). Still open → settle in RM-103 spec: playbook scope (per-context vs central)._

---

### Cluster 18 — Release-flow guardrails

_Proposed (added 2026-05-31). Seeded by a real incident on a downstream project: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` was committed on `develop` before the `develop` → `main` PR merged, leaving the tag unreachable from `main`. The consumer project's runbook teaches the correct order, but that is documentation-level defence. A programmatic guardrail inside Octopus is missing._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-105 | Pre-push hook that rejects `git push --tags` when a release tag (`v*` by default) is not reachable from the main branch (`main` by default). Configurable via `.octopus.yml` (default branch and tag pattern). Explicit bypass via env var for emergencies. Pairs with the consumer runbook as the programmatic layer | hooks |

---

### Cluster 19 — Knowledge-root operations (briefing / synthesize / hygiene)

_Proposed (added 2026-05-31). Seeds from [research](research/2026-05-31-knowledge-root-operations.md): "summarize a base on a cadence", "surface connections that cross nodes", and "audit staleness/orphans/archive" are operations over **any linked markdown tree**, not a manager-specific need. Octopus already has four such roots (`docs/`, the standards set, auto-memory, the consigliere workspace) and already does fragments of this in `plan-backlog-hygiene` / `audit-config` / `doc-align`. One generic engine parameterized by a **knowledge root** replaces that fragmentation; the consigliere becomes one root + lens profile. Build order: RM-106 → RM-107/108/109 (independent) → RM-110._

_**Status: Cluster 19 complete** — RM-106 (#120), RM-107 (#123), RM-108 (#126), RM-109 (#128), RM-110 (#130) all shipped. The knowledge-root engines (`octopus kr`/`hygiene`/`synthesize`/`briefing`/`lens`) operate over any linked markdown tree; the consigliere is one registered root + opus lens profile._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-106 | knowledge-root abstraction — config-declared registry: each root declares path, link convention (`relative` / `[[ ]]` / fan-out / none), archive dir, staleness threshold, optional lens profile, optional read-only source adapter (e.g. Obsidian vault, mirroring `consigliere-connect-atlassian`). Built-in roots: `docs/`, standards set, auto-memory, consigliere workspace. Solves: stops the three engines from each re-implementing "what tree, how linked, where archive" | foundation |
| RM-107 | `knowledge-hygiene` skill — staleness + coverage + broken-link + archive audit over a target root; report + reversible `--fix`. `--gaps` mode adds documentation-coverage detection: nodes missing a known field *and* recurring entities that appear across journals/sources but never got their own node ("what do I talk about and never documented?"). Subsumes the staleness/orphan/link concern that `plan-backlog-hygiene` + `audit-config` cover partially (spec decides fold-as-target vs keep-specialized — no third silo). Solves: bases decay silently; stale state read as current is worse than none, and undocumented topics stay invisible | maintenance |
| RM-108 | `knowledge-synthesize` skill — surface connections that cross nodes of a root (shared blocker, doc contradicting an ADR, forgotten-but-relevant note); seeds/repairs the link convention where missing. Strongest targets: auto-memory (`[[ ]]`, built to be linked) and `docs/` (specs vs ADRs). Solves: every root is a silo; cross-node patterns only surface if you already suspect them | cross-node traversal |
| RM-109 | `knowledge-briefing` skill — generated summary over a target root on a cadence; `--daily` (attention deltas), `--weekly` (rollup). Read-only, grounded; cadence hosted by `/schedule`/`/loop`. Strongest targets: consigliere workspace, `docs/`+roadmap. Solves: a base only speaks when spoken to — nothing surfaces "what changed / what needs you today" | proactive output |
| RM-110 | consigliere lens profile — register the private workspace as a root (fan-out links, archive, threshold) + attach the consigliere lens (political-risk surfacing, per-node `playbook.md`, "thinks like you" voice) so RM-107…109 output reads like the consigliere when target = workspace; honors ADR-007 write-guard. Solves: delivers the manager proactive/synthesis/maintenance layer by reusing the engines, not duplicating them | consigliere |

_RM-106 has a [spec](specs/knowledge-root-registry.md). Architecture decisions settled: config scoping per-repo/per-user with a load-time guard ([ADR-009](adr/009-knowledge-root-config-scoping.md)); hygiene boundary — fold `plan-backlog-hygiene`, keep `audit-config` separate ([ADR-010](adr/010-knowledge-hygiene-boundary.md))._

### Cluster 20 — Completion-verification guardrail

_Proposed (added 2026-05-31). Closes the two failure modes the RM-088 PRD ([docs/specs/local-guardrails-quality-style-grounding.md](specs/local-guardrails-quality-style-grounding.md)) explicitly deferred. RM-088 shipped the **syntactic block** (`guardrails` bundle) and the **semantic signal** (`audit-grounding` skill + `grounding-check` Stop hook); the third side of the local-guardrail triad — the **verification signal** — was left out of scope: "non-existent APIs / missing files" and the "claimed done without running" failure mode. An agent can assert a task is complete or passing without ever executing the build/test/typecheck, and reference a symbol the type-checker would reject — neither is caught today (the type-checker only catches it if it is run)._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-111 | `audit-verification` skill + `verification-check` Stop hook — signal-only, mirroring `audit-grounding`'s shape. At task end on a code diff, the hook queues a review; the skill confronts the session's completion claim against run evidence (did the build/test/typecheck actually run this session?) and flags unresolved-symbol / missing-file references the type-checker would reject. Never blocks (the syntactic gate already blocks at commit; this signals the "claimed done without running" gap). Registers in `quality` beside `audit-grounding`; pairs with the `guardrails` syntactic block | local guardrail |

_Seed: the [RM-088 PRD](specs/local-guardrails-quality-style-grounding.md)'s Out-of-Scope section._

_**Status: Cluster 20 complete** — RM-111 shipped in #134. The local-guardrail triad is closed: syntactic **block** (`guardrails`) + semantic **signal** (`audit-grounding`) + verification **signal** (`audit-verification`). The recurring hook is zero-LLM; the judgment is cheap-tier on demand via `/octopus:review-proposals`._

---

### Cluster 21 — Semantic quality/style signal

_**Implemented** (added 2026-06-02). Seeds from [research](research/2026-06-02-audit-style-rules-aware.md): the RM-088 PRD was titled "Quality, Style **& Grounding**" but shipped only the syntactic block (`guardrails`) and the semantic **grounding** signal (`audit-grounding`). The semantic **design/quality** signal — judging conformance to the opinionated rules in `rules/common/*` and flagging over-engineering — was never built. The native `/simplify` cannot fill it (no project rules, no memory across runs, and it may itself introduce the over-abstraction the rules forbid). The fix is the `audit-grounding` shape pointed at a different source of truth: the house rules._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-112 | `audit-style` skill — semantic, signal-only reviewer confronting the diff against the opinionated design rules (`exceptions.md` gate G1/G2/G3, Result-vs-throw, boolean-param→options, magic numbers, guard clauses, layer separation) + active stack rules, with an explicit **anti-over-engineering** dimension (premature abstraction, speculative hierarchy, DRY-before-three). Mirrors `audit-grounding` (signal-only, `warn`/`info`, structural tests); registers in `quality`, orchestrated by `codereview`/`pr-review`/`implement`; **no new Stop hook**. Recurring findings reuse the existing `continuous-learning`/`review-proposals` loop (RM-093 at team level) → rule/CLAUDE.md candidates | local guardrail |

_Decisions: positioned as an `audit-*` sibling (not a `simplify` wrapper); skill-only (no per-session hook, and **not** part of `audit-all`'s domain dispatch — like `audit-grounding`/`audit-verification`, it runs via the review flows); knowledge loop reused, not a new RM. Distinct from `refactor-deepen` (deepens design) and native `/simplify` (generic taste, applies fixes). Implemented: `skills/audit-style/SKILL.md`, `quality` bundle, EN+pt-br docs pages, `tests/test_audit_style.sh`._

---

### Cluster 22 — CLI surface hygiene

_Proposed (added 2026-06-02). Seeds from [research](research/2026-06-02-cli-surface-hygiene.md): a question — "the CLI accepts params not in the help; which, and why?" — surfaced a structural gap, not a docs gap. `cli/octopus.sh` infers commands from file existence (`source cli/lib/<cmd>.sh`, no allowlist), so every lib is an accepted command — including helper libs that silently no-op — and the help is split across two hand-maintained, drifting layers (`bin/octopus` shows 5 commands; the 17 workflow commands appear only on bare `octopus`). Conventional affordances are missing (`octopus --version` prints "Unknown command"; no per-command `--help`), and `doctor` is anemic. The keystone is a declarative command registry that both guards the dispatch and generates the help; the rest builds on it. Build order: RM-113 → RM-114/115; RM-116 is independent._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-113 | Command registry + generated help + lib guard — replace "command = a `cli/lib/*.sh` exists" with a declarative registry (central list or `# @command:` marker); dispatch validates against it (helper libs error instead of no-op); help is **generated** from it and **unified** (`octopus help`/`--help` lists every command, ending the two-layer `bin/octopus` vs `cli/octopus.sh` split). Single source of truth for dispatch guard + help; kills the drift at the source | foundation |
| RM-114 | Conventional CLI affordances — `octopus version`/`--version` (today errors "Unknown command"), `octopus help <cmd>` + `--help`/`-h` per subcommand, `octopus list` (generated), `octopus completions [bash\|zsh\|fish]`. Enabled by RM-113's registry; `version` trivial, `completions` heaviest/lowest | conventions |
| RM-115 | Document the hidden-but-real surface — a "Configuration / Environment" section for the `OCTOPUS_*` env vars, the full `setup` flag set (`--no-hooks`/`--no-workflow`/`--bundle`/`--stack`/`--reviewers`), and the `release` subcommands; bilingual docs-site pages. Mostly docs; part auto-covered by RM-113's generated help | docs |
| RM-116 | `octopus doctor` as the health command — grow it from version/path into read-only detection: stale hook paths in `settings.json` (version-pinned `cache/vX.Y.Z` entries pointing at a deleted release — the class fixed in `deliver_hooks`), rotten cache symlinks, version drift across repos, stale translations. Reuses `audit-config`. Independent of the registry | health |

_Decisions: the `bin/octopus` shim vs `cli/octopus.sh` workflow split is intentional (bootstrap/version-management vs workflow) — RM-113 unifies the **help**, not the binaries. Registry is opt-in (explicit), not opt-out, so the "file = command" coupling that caused the problem is removed. Implementation libs (`knowledge-*`, `consigliere-lens`, `audit-map`, `ui`, `setup-picker`) stay internal — the registry simply omits them._

_**RM-113 implemented** — `cli/lib/commands.default` (pipe-delimited registry mirroring `knowledge-roots.default`); `cli/octopus.sh` generates its help from it and rejects any unregistered name (helper libs no longer no-op); `bin/octopus` `print_help` reads the registry so `octopus help` lists global + workflow commands; `help` is a first-class command. Tests: `tests/test_cli_registry.sh`. RM-114/115/116 remain proposed._

---

## In Progress

_RM-088 (`audit-grounding`) shipped in v1.69.0. **Cluster 16** (manager-multiplier) is **complete on `feat/standards-lookup`** — all implemented & committed, pending merge/release: RM-089 (`mentor`), RM-090 (`onboarding`), RM-091 (`definition-of-done`), RM-092 (`standards`), RM-093 (team `continuous-learning`), RM-094 (`audit-fleet`), RM-095 (`fleet-bootstrap`), RM-096 (`tech-lead` bundle), RM-098 (`map-system` complete-mode deck). ADRs 002–006 recorded. See [research](research/2026-05-30-manager-multiplier.md)._
