# Roadmap

This file is the project backlog — ideas that need team discussion
before becoming a spec.

## Two valid entry paths

1. **Roadmap-first** — for ideas that benefit from async brainstorm
   or team validation. Run `/octopus:doc-research <slug>` to produce
   a research doc + new RM entry. The RM graduates to a Spec or RFC
   when work begins; when that happens, update the item's status to
   "in progress" and link the new document.

2. **Spec-first** — for work that already came out of a synchronous
   brainstorm (e.g. the `superpowers:brainstorming` skill) with a
   clear rationale and scope. Create the spec directly via
   `/octopus:doc-spec <slug>` — no RM needed. The spec itself
   carries the "why" and links from the CHANGELOG entry keep the
   history visible.

Use spec-first when the brainstorm already happened; use
roadmap-first when the idea still needs shaping.

### Cluster 14 — Engineering process skills

_RM-075..084 complete. Shipped across v1.45.0 → v1.49.0 (`doc-align`, `test-tdd`, `refactor-deepen`, `map-system`, `triage-issues`, `doc-prd`, `prototype`, `context-handoff`, `scaffold-skill`, `interview`)._

### Cluster 15 — Claude Code in large codebases (article-parity)

_RM-085..087 complete. Shipped across v1.50.0 → v1.51.0 (`doc-subcontext`, knowledge-update Stop hook, `audit-config`)._

#### Parked (Tier B) — not roadmapped

- **LSP integration** — the article calls out language-server
  symbol navigation as a critical practice for typed languages.
  High value, high effort (probably needs an MCP server wrapping
  language servers per stack). **Acknowledged but not roadmapped**
  pending explicit demand. When demand arrives, open as a
  dedicated planning round.
- **`.claudeignore` template** — small surface; `permissions.deny`
  in settings covers most cases today. Revisit if a user reports
  the gap.
- **Per-subdirectory test/lint commands** — `auto-format.sh`
  already scopes by file path; full-suite test timeouts haven't
  been reported. Revisit if monorepos start hitting it.

### Cluster 16 — Manager multiplier / engineering leadership

_**Complete on `feat/standards-lookup`** — all of RM-089…096 + RM-098 implemented and committed (pending merge/release). Seeds from [research](research/2026-05-30-manager-multiplier.md): extend Octopus so a tech manager can standardize and raise the team's bar across 6+ repos without being the bottleneck._

| RM | Item | Theme |
|----|------|-------|
| RM-089 | `mentor` role — coaching review persona that teaches the *why* | pedagogy |
| RM-090 | `onboarding` skill — ramp a new engineer onto standards + codebase + workflow | pedagogy |
| RM-091 | `definition-of-done` skill + artifact — first-class team DoD | pedagogy |
| RM-092 | `standards` self-serve lookup — "what's our standard for X / why" | pedagogy |
| RM-093 | Team-level `continuous-learning` — recurring PR feedback → rule candidates | knowledge loop |
| RM-094 | `audit-fleet` — cross-repo adoption + drift audit | cross-repo |
| RM-095 | Fleet bootstrap — bulk-apply a standard `.octopus.yml` across repos | cross-repo |
| RM-096 | `tech-lead` bundle — composes the manager kit | bundle |
| RM-098 | `map-system --save` — themed self-contained HTML deck of the repo (overview, business insights, diagrams, API contracts) via frontend-design + launch-release themes; RM-090 depends on it | pedagogy |
