All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.57.0] - 2026-05-20

✨ Phase 5 of the docs site lands at https://leocosta.github.io/octopus/skills/ — the Skills section with 19 hand-curated MDX pages (overview + 18 detail) replacing the auto-synced placeholders from `docs/features/`. Same granularity rule: 35 skills total, the ones with non-trivial design decisions get a detail page; thin wrappers and stack-specific patterns (e.g. `dotnet`, `backend-patterns`, `batch`, `content-images`, `test-tdd`, `test-e2e`) are listed in the overview tables with one-liners. Overview groups by intent — audits / workflows / refactoring / doc lifecycle / knowledge & planning / launches / skill authoring / stack patterns / receiving review — and links to either the skill page or to the command page that already covers the discipline (review-pr → /commands/pr-comments/, scaffold-skill → /commands/scaffold-skill/). 📝 The 18 detail pages: **implement** (the five practices and why a default skill rather than a rule), **debug** (six-step loop and why structure beats vibes), **prototype** (terminal vs UI variations and what "throwaway" actually means), **audit-all** (composer-not-monolith rationale and what it adds beyond serial), **audit-security** (four axes covering the recurring carelessness that produces real incidents), **audit-money** (seven checks codifying the failure modes that recur across codebases — types, rounding, cents-not-round tests, env drift, idempotency, webhook signatures, fee-disclosure coupling), **audit-tenant** (five checks plus blast-radius rationale and EF Core convention pairing), **audit-config** (RM-087 five-check freshness audit and why no auto-fix), **review-contracts** (six axes targeting drift that breaks runtime behaviour while ignoring intentional divergence), **refactor-deepen** (why consolidation helps AI navigation, CONTEXT.md and ADR signal sources), **doc-lifecycle** (the two-question route between RFC/Spec/ADR/Knowledge), **doc-adr** (when ADR vs Spec, four sections with Consequences as the undervalued one, supersession discipline), **doc-plan** (TDD-sized tasks vs feature-sized, enriched-plan frontmatter, parallel DAG via depends_on), **doc-subcontext** (RM-085 inherit-don't-duplicate, 50-100 line target, when not to write one), **plan-backlog** (six finding types and why --fix only handles archives), **continuous-learning** (lifecycle of a learning from capture to promotion or retirement, multi-agent-ready design), **launch-feature** (why a skill instead of marketer-writes-it, voice per channel, approval-gated by tools allowlist), **launch-release** (themed nine-channel kit and theme synthesis). 🔧 `site/scripts/sync-content.sh` no longer auto-syncs `docs/features/` for any of the three sections — Hooks, Commands, and Skills are all hand-curated MDX. Architecture stays commented in the sidebar; ships in Phase 6.

## [1.56.0] - 2026-05-20

✨ Phase 4 of the docs site lands at https://leocosta.github.io/octopus/commands/ — the Commands section with 13 hand-curated MDX pages (overview + 12 detail) replacing the auto-synced placeholder from `docs/features/`. Granularity follows the same "rationale-worthy only" rule as Hooks: 40 commands total, ~28 are listed in the overview table grouped by the phase of work they support (PR lifecycle, doc lifecycle, audits, implementation, orchestration, launches, skill-authoring, meta) and link either to their owning skill page (for thin command-as-skill-wrapper) or to a detail page (for commands with their own design decisions). 📝 The 12 detail pages: **branch-create** (prefix discipline anchors the release-bump chain, format validation refuses underscores/camelCase, default base picks `release/*` when active), **commit** (four-step language resolution from `language.local.md` → `.octopus.yml` → `git log` detection → English default, AI co-authored trailer rule, refusal of `--no-verify` / secrets-looking files / mixed-concern diffs), **pr-open** (why prose lives in the agent and mechanics live in `octopus.sh` — bash can't summarise a diff, the agent has the conversation context — emoji-by-prefix map, body template), **pr-review** (six-axis self-review checklist — correctness/design/readability/edge-cases/security/tests — and why it's narrower than `codereview`), **pr-comments** (verify / ask-for-evidence / disagree-with-reasoning triage against the two failure modes of feedback handling: performative compliance and defensive pushback), **pr-merge** (squash-as-default rationale — PR is the unit of review — no `--force` flag is deliberate, refusal conditions including the chore(release) version-mismatch catch), **dev-flow** (orchestration with explicit human pauses between phases, phase table, three cases where individual commands beat the orchestrator), **delegate** (single-role dispatch and multi-step pipelines via sequencing language — "after", "once", "then" sequential, "and" parallel — full role-alias table), **release** (the six-step bundle rationale, semver heuristic from commit types, CHANGELOG narrative voice over bullet lists, README badge sync via regex), **scaffold-skill** (why scaffolded vs freeform — frontmatter description / triggers / bundle membership all have to be right for engagement to work — bundle-assignment rule preventing orphans), **doc-research** (the roadmap-first vs spec-first paths, the five-step interview shape, RM status lifecycle), **review-proposals** (four dispositions — promote / partial / archive / discard — and why promotion routes through the owning skill so each target's voice is preserved). 🔧 `site/scripts/sync-content.sh` no longer auto-syncs `docs/features/commands.md`; like Hooks, the section is now hand-curated MDX. Skills section still auto-syncs the remaining per-skill rationale pages until Phase 5.

## [1.55.0] - 2026-05-20

✨ Phase 3 of the docs site lands at https://leocosta.github.io/octopus/hooks/ — the Hooks section with 6 hand-curated MDX pages replacing the auto-synced placeholder from `docs/features/`. Granularity follows the "rationale-worthy only" rule that pairs the docs-site voice with the actual decisions in the hooks layer: twelve hooks that are one-liners are listed in the overview table without their own page; five hooks with non-trivial design decisions ship as detail pages. The **overview** (`hooks/index.mdx`) explains why hooks live below skills (runtime enforcement vs. prompt advice — the layer where Octopus guarantees hold whether the agent is Claude Code in `bypassPermissions`, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, or OpenCode), tables the 9 Claude Code lifecycle phases with their stop-on-non-zero semantics, lists all 17 installed hooks with phase + one-liner, and documents two-level opt-out (`hooks: false` vs. `destructiveGuard: false`) plus the agent-coverage story (rules-inlined fallback for non-Claude agents). 📝 The five detail pages: **destructive-guard** (patterns blocked, inline `# destructive-guard-ok: <reason>` marker rationale — visibility/per-command/audit-friendly — opt-out, known regex-bypass limit), **detect-secrets** (provider grammars covering AWS / Stripe / SendGrid / Slack / GitHub / OpenAI / JWT / private-key blocks, deliberate no-bypass-by-design, pairing with `audit-security` as PreToolUse-gate vs. audit-pass), **auto-format** (why post-tool not pre-tool — agents reason in iterations, formatters normalise rather than reject — full formatter map keyed by extension, never-fail-on-formatter-error policy, the "formatter overrides agent intent" failure mode, typecheck inline with cold-start cost note), **propose-knowledge-update** (the three RM-086 signals — corrections / re-reads / re-greps — and why each separately rather than collapsed into one metric, proposal-not-auto-update discipline, graceful degradation when `jq` or `transcript_path` is absent), **pre-push-audit-suggest** (advisory-not-blocking rationale — audits are heavy and per-push cost would breed `--no-verify` workarounds — diff-to-audit pattern map for the five audits, env-var opt-out). 🔧 `site/scripts/sync-content.sh` no longer auto-syncs `docs/features/hooks.md` and `destructive-action-guard.md` — the section is now hand-curated MDX, not a derived view. Architecture section stays commented in the sidebar pending a later phase.

## [1.54.1] - 2026-05-20

🔧 The docs-site sidebar listed **Roadmap** and **Changelog** entries pointing at `/roadmap/` and `/changelog/`, but both routes 404'd — no MDX pages existed for them. `site/scripts/sync-content.sh` now generates the pages at sync time from the canonical sources (`docs/roadmap.md` maintained by `/octopus:doc-research`, `CHANGELOG.md` maintained by the release flow), prepending Starlight frontmatter and stripping the source H1. Pages ship as `.md` rather than `.mdx` because the raw content contains curly braces and HTML-like fragments that MDX tries to parse as JSX. The next push to `CHANGELOG.md` already triggers the docs-site rebuild, so future releases will land on `/changelog/` automatically without further wiring.

## [1.54.0] - 2026-05-20

✨ Brand identity refresh. The previous logo and cover were realistic 3D-rendered octopi clutching third-party AI assistant logos (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Copilot) on a baked-in dark background — visually busy, didn't scale to favicon size, didn't adapt to light mode, and pulled focus toward the third-party marks rather than Octopus itself. The new mark is a clean geometric octopus head with eight tentacles radiating outward into glowing terminal nodes — a literal "one source orchestrating many endpoints" metaphor matching what the tool actually does. Each asset ships in two transparent-PNG variants: electric cyan (`*-dark.png`, glowing strokes for dark surfaces) and deep indigo (`*-light.png`, solid strokes for light surfaces). Starlight's `logo` config is rewired from a single `src:` to `light:` + `dark:`, so the docs site top-nav mark follows the user's color scheme automatically. The README hero uses a `<picture>` element with `prefers-color-scheme` for the same behavior on GitHub. `scripts/generate-brand.mjs` is checked in so the asset set is reproducible: reads the OpenAI API key from a sibling project's `.env`, calls `gpt-image-1` with `background: transparent`, writes all four variants in one run. 🔧 `site/scripts/sync-content.sh` now copies all six brand PNGs into `site/public/` at build (vs. just two), and `.gitignore` grows the matching synced-asset entries — `images/` stays the source of truth, `site/public/*` stays generated. New `site/src/pages/brand-preview.astro` route renders every variant on light, dark, and transparency-checker tiles side by side so brand changes can be eyeballed locally at `/brand-preview` before promotion. 📝 README compacted from 427 lines to 78. The previous README had grown into a second handbook duplicating Quick Start, the full `octopus control` TUI walkthrough, the `octopus run` pipeline, the `octopus ask` streaming docs, and the entire `.octopus.yml` reference — all of which now live at https://leocosta.github.io/octopus/. The new shape is an overview-only card: `<picture>` hero, one-sentence pitch, what-you-get bullets, install one-liners, then a prominent CTA funneling readers into the docs site for the deep content. Architecture and contributing pointers were updated to link into the docs site instead of stale relative paths under `docs/features/`.

## [1.53.1] - 2026-05-20

🎨 Use a dedicated logo asset for the docs site top-nav. The previous logo was `images/cover.png` — the wide cover image with the "AI Agents Orchestrator" tagline baked in — which worked as a hero but was too busy for the small top-nav slot on every doc page. New asset `images/logo.png` is a cleaner branded logo with the "OCTOPUS" wordmark on a light background; Starlight is configured with `replacesTitle: true` since the wordmark is in the image. `cover.png` stays as the landing-page hero referenced from `site/src/pages/index.astro` — different image for different surfaces. Sync script copies both into `site/public/` at build time; both are gitignored under the synced-asset rule.

## [1.53.0] - 2026-05-20

✨ Phase 2 of the docs site lands at https://leocosta.github.io/octopus/ — 11 hand-written rationale pages (plus 2 section index pages) covering every bundle and role Octopus ships. Each bundle page documents the team archetype it targets, the workflow it enables, the rationale for each included skill, the explicit exclusions (why certain skills did *not* make it in), and which other bundles compose with it. The 5 bundle pages: **starter** (foundation, 11 skills, no opt-out), **quality** (audit composer + architect role), **docs** (full doc lifecycle, 11 skills + writer role), **backend** (stack-aware patterns + backend-developer role), **growth** (multi-channel launch kits + marketer role). 📝 The 6 role pages document persona, frontmatter (model + color + tools allowlist where applicable), scope and boundaries (what the role owns vs does NOT own — explicit refusals), how the role behaves differently from the default agent, the workflow phases, and when to delegate vs when not to. The roles: **architect** (senior reviewer, BLOCKING/ADVISORY/QUESTION discipline, opus model), **backend-developer** (stack-aware implementer with fixed layer order), **frontend-developer** (UX / a11y / performance gates), **marketer** (approval-gated publishing, code-modification forbidden by tools allowlist), **product-manager** (SaaS metrics, problem-first, no code), **writer** (docs as product, RFC → Spec → ADR → Knowledge chain). Both section index pages (`bundles/index.mdx`, `roles/index.mdx`) frame the concept itself — how to pick a bundle, when to author a new one, role vs skill distinction, delegate mechanics. Site sidebar autogenerate picks up the new directories without config changes. Build verified: 19 pages, 1829 words indexed in Pagefind search.

## [1.52.0] - 2026-05-20

✨ Phase 1 of the Octopus docs site lands at https://leocosta.github.io/octopus/. The site is built with Astro Starlight 0.32.6 (picked over Docusaurus, Jekyll, mdBook, and VitePress for being docs-native, MDX-native, Pagefind-search-native, and lighter than the React stacks) and deploys via a GitHub Actions workflow on every change to `site/**`, `docs/site/**`, `images/cover.png`, `README.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md`. Source-of-truth lives in `docs/site/` (versioned alongside the code); `site/` is just the renderer that reads from there. A `site/scripts/sync-content.sh` script hard-copies (not symlinks — they break Vite's import resolution for `@astrojs/starlight/components` inside MDX) `docs/site/*` into `site/src/content/docs/*` at build time. 📝 Four hand-written Get Started pages (~700 lines of product-narrative content): **What is Octopus** frames the configuration-sprawl problem and Octopus's role as the layer above Claude Code / Codex / Copilot / Gemini / OpenCode; **Installation** covers the one-liner installers, update flow, version pinning, source builds, and uninstall; **Quick Start** is a six-step walkthrough from `octopus update` through first-skill engagement, discovery commands, customisation, and optional daemon mode; **Mental Model** documents the five primitives (Bundle / Skill / Command / Hook / Role) with concrete examples and explicit non-primitives (rules, knowledge, MCP, meta-bundles). 🔧 `site/STYLE.md` locks the voice and page anatomy for the 90+ rationale pages landing in Phases 2–5. 🔧 Custom 404 page; sitemap and search index built automatically by Starlight; site title, social links, and edit-on-GitHub links wired to the `leocosta/octopus` repo. Reference / bundles / skills / commands / hooks / roles sections are stubbed in the sidebar but unimplemented in this phase — they ship in v1.53.0 through v1.56.0 per the plan in the v1.52.0 commit message.

## [1.51.1] - 2026-05-20

📝 Roadmap status backfill — the ten Cluster 14 RMs (RM-075..084) shipped across v1.45.0 → v1.49.0 but were still listed as `proposed` in `docs/roadmap.md`. Each entry's status now reflects its actual release: RM-075/076/077/079/080/081/082 shipped in v1.45.0, RM-078 shipped skill in v1.45.0 and command in v1.46.0, RM-083 shipped skill in v1.45.0 and command in v1.48.0, RM-084 shipped in v1.47.0. The In-Progress footer is rewritten to say "All clusters complete through RM-087; Cluster 14 shipped across v1.45.0 → v1.49.0; Cluster 15 shipped across v1.50.0 → v1.51.0". This is exactly the kind of configuration drift that `audit-config` (RM-087) was designed to catch — running `/octopus:audit-config` would now flag any similar staleness in future commits.

## [1.51.0] - 2026-05-19

✨ Ship RM-086 — Stop hook for CLAUDE.md / knowledge update proposals — closing Cluster 15. The Claude Code Stop-hook viability check confirmed that hooks receive `transcript_path` on stdin JSON, pointing at a JSONL file with full user + assistant turns and tool calls. The new hook `hooks/stop/propose-knowledge-update.sh` parses that transcript with `jq` and writes a proposal to `.octopus/proposals/<timestamp>.md` when any of three signals exceeds threshold: **corrections** (user messages starting with `no`, `não`, `don't`, `stop`, `wrong`, `actually`, `instead`, `remove` — strict start-of-message pattern reduces false positives), **re-reads** (same file Read'd 3+ times — threshold of 3 skips the normal edit cycle of read → edit → review), and **re-greps** (same pattern grep'd 3+ times — recurring searches usually mean the answer belongs in `CONTEXT.md` or a skill description). The hook is read-only on the project tree and writes only to `.octopus/proposals/` (gitignored). Empty proposals are never written. Promotion to `CLAUDE.md` / `knowledge/` / `rules/` happens via the new `/octopus:review-proposals` command under human review — four dispositions (`promote`, `partial`, `archive`, `discard`) route promote/partial through the owning skill (`continuous-learning`, `doc-adr`, `doc-subcontext`) so discipline applies. Smoke-tested against a real Octopus session transcript: detected 3 Portuguese corrections and 10 files re-read 3+ times (one file 48× — clear knowledge-gap signal). 🔧 Graceful degradation: if `jq` is missing or `transcript_path` is absent (older Claude Code or other agents), the hook exits 0 silently. 📝 Roadmap marks Cluster 15 complete.

## [1.50.0] - 2026-05-19

✨ Ship two of the three Cluster 15 gaps identified against Anthropic's *"How Claude Code Works in Large Codebases"* article. RM-086 (Stop hook for knowledge update proposals) is deferred pending a Claude Code Stop-hook viability check. **RM-085 — `doc-subcontext` skill + `/octopus:doc-subcontext` command** closes the article's top scaling gap: per-module `CLAUDE.md` files in monorepos. The skill reads the parent chain first to avoid duplication, asks only about conventions **unique to the chosen subdirectory**, writes lean (target 50–100 lines), and cross-references the parent with "inherits from ../CLAUDE.md" instead of copying — registered in the `docs` bundle next to `doc-adr` and `doc-lifecycle`. **RM-087 — `audit-config` skill + `/octopus:audit-config` command** closes the article's 3–6 month freshness audit gap. Five checks run over `rules/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, `commands/`, `bundles/`: (a) model-specific assumptions like "Opus 3" or "Claude 3.5"; (b) stale date references older than 9 months without a successor; (c) phantom skills with no `triggers:` and no routing cue in the description; (d) hooks untouched since the last model-family change (heuristic); (e) commands referencing deprecated paths — the canonical example is the `docs/superpowers/plans/` cleanup from v1.49.x. Severity-tiered report (`⛔ block` / `⚠ warn` / `ℹ info`) in the same shape as `audit-all`. Read-only — never auto-fixes; the user applies fixes as separate commits. Has `triggers:` frontmatter for auto-engagement on configuration-surface edits, and is registered in the `quality` bundle next to `audit-all` and `refactor-deepen`. 🧪 Tests in `test_bundles.sh` updated for the new `quality` skill (Test 7 union expected list, Test 9 expansion count 17 → 18). 📝 Roadmap marks RM-085 and RM-087 as `shipped (v1.50.0)`; RM-086 remains `proposed`.

## [1.49.3] - 2026-05-19

📝 Add Cluster 15 to `docs/roadmap.md` based on a gap analysis against Anthropic's *"How Claude Code Works in Large Codebases — Best Practices and Where to Start"* blog post. Octopus already covers most of the article's recommendations (skills, hooks, subagents, MCP templates, plan-before-code, codebase maps via `map-system`, plugin/marketplace distribution via bundles, restart/handoff via `context-handoff`, continuous learning). Three gaps were identified and roadmapped: RM-085 (🟠 High) — subdirectory `CLAUDE.md` tooling, the article's top scaling practice that Octopus does not currently support beyond the root file; RM-086 (🟡 Medium) — Stop hook for CLAUDE.md / knowledge update proposals, automating what `continuous-learning` does manually today; RM-087 (🟡 Medium) — configuration freshness audit, scanning rules/skills/hooks/commands/bundles for model-specific assumptions, stale dates, deprecated paths, and skills without triggers. LSP integration is acknowledged as a Tier B gap but parked pending explicit demand. This release is report-only — no skills, commands, or hooks implemented; the cluster awaits prioritisation.

## [1.49.2] - 2026-05-19

📝 Complete the `docs/superpowers/plans/` purge started in v1.49.1. The directory contents were untracked there; this release removes the path from the active codebase — `skills/plan-backlog/SKILL.md` no longer autodetects it, `commands/plan-backlog.md` and `docs/features/plan-backlog.md` drop it from the scan paths, `commands/doc-design.md` and `docs/specs/doc-design-command.md` point at existing `docs/plans/` instead of the external pattern source, and `docs/specs/doc-plan-command.md` rephrases the two contrast mentions to "external plan-storage convention" instead of naming the directory. Plugin references (`superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:writing-plans`, `superpowers:systematic-debugging`, etc.) are deliberately kept — they document real integration with the externally-installed `superpowers` plugin (routing between overlapping skills, hand-off to more appropriate siblings, historical motivation for Octopus skills).

## [1.49.1] - 2026-05-19

🔧 Stop tracking `docs/superpowers/` contents. The 8 plan and spec files under that directory were committed before `/docs/superpowers` was added to `.gitignore`; git ignores `.gitignore` entries for already-tracked files, so they remained in the index. Untracked via `git rm --cached` (files stay on the user's disk locally so superpowers workflows continue to work), and `/.superpowers/` added to `.gitignore` so the root-level plugin cache is explicitly ignored too. References to the `docs/superpowers/plans/` path in `plan-backlog`, `doc-design`, `doc-plan`, and related skills/commands are unchanged — those are directory-scan conventions, not file links, and remain valid even when the directory is untracked.

## [1.49.0] - 2026-05-19

✨ Adds `triggers:` frontmatter to three Cluster 14 skills that have real, non-ambiguous routing signals, matching the pattern already used by `audit-money` (keywords), `compress-skill` (paths), and `plan-backlog` (paths). `triage-issues` engages on `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**` and `.out-of-scope/**` paths plus the state-transition vocabulary (`triage`, `wontfix`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `out-of-scope`) — editing those paths or using that language IS triage work. `prototype` engages on `**/__prototype__/**`, `**/LOGIC.md`, and `**/UI.md` paths plus the keywords `prototype`, `throwaway`, `sanity-check` — re-engaging when the user opens an existing prototype directory or one of the skill's canonical artifacts is the highest-signal moment to resurface its discipline. `scaffold-skill` engages on keywords only (`new skill`, `create skill`, `scaffold skill`, `author skill`, `scaffold-skill`) because the skill creates files that do not exist yet, making path-based engagement impossible. The other seven Cluster 14 skills (`doc-align`, `test-tdd`, `refactor-deepen`, `map-system`, `doc-prd`, `context-handoff`, `interview`) are deliberately left without `triggers:` — they are workflow-initiated or manual-invocation-only by design, and adding file-reactive triggers would either fire on every edit (noise) or violate the skill's own discipline (in the case of `map-system`).

## [1.48.0] - 2026-05-19

🔧 Cluster 14 cleanup release fixing one blocker and two self-consistency bugs found in an audit pass, plus one coverage gap closed. 🐛 The bundle-assertion tests (`tests/test_bundles.sh` tests 5, 7, 9) hardcoded expected skill lists from before Cluster 14 expanded `starter` by 4 skills (`test-tdd`, `map-system`, `prototype`, `context-handoff`) and `quality` by 1 (`refactor-deepen`) — the tests would have failed on the next CI run; the expected lists and the bundle-expansion count assertion (12 → 17) are now updated. 📝 The `scaffold-skill` REFERENCE.md mandated a `capability + "Use when …"` shape for skill descriptions, but zero existing Octopus skills follow that shape (`debug`, `implement`, `delegate`, `audit-money`, `compress-skill`, `plan-backlog`, `doc-lifecycle` all use *capability + integration cues* like "Active by default on every bug-triage task; pairs with implement"); the rule is now softened to "capability + integration cues (pairs / active by default / family / triggers)", the Good description example is replaced with the actual `audit-money` description, and a note about the `triggers:` frontmatter field (used by `audit-money`, `compress-skill`, `plan-backlog`) is added. 📝 `interview`'s description was the only skill following the old (incorrect) mandate after v1.47.1; it is now normalised to the Octopus shape — "pairs with doc-research" replaces the "Use when …" sentence, with no information loss (the boundary cue is preserved in `When to Engage` and `Integration with Other Skills`). ✨ New `/octopus:scaffold-skill` slash command for parity with the other Cluster 14 commands (`/octopus:doc-prd`, `/octopus:triage-issues`, `/octopus:prototype`, `/octopus:context-handoff`, `/octopus:map-system`, `/octopus:interview`) — `scaffold-skill` is an explicit user-facing entry point ("I want to create a new skill") and deserves a canonical invocation; follows the exact pattern of `commands/map-system.md`.

## [1.47.1] - 2026-05-19

📝 Clarify the boundary between `/octopus:interview` and `/octopus:doc-research` in the agent-facing descriptions and the `When to Engage` / `Purpose` sections. Both surfaces ask "one question at a time" and can be triggered by phrases like "let's think about X", so the picker needs a clean differentiator: `interview` scopes **one** feature or problem into concrete intent, `doc-research` explores an **area** and generates **multiple** backlog items. The integration section in `skills/interview/SKILL.md` now documents the natural sequencing `doc-research → picks RM-NNN → interview → doc-align → doc-prd → implement`.

## [1.47.0] - 2026-05-19

✨ New `interview` skill + `/octopus:interview` slash command (RM-084) close the gap missed in the initial Cluster 14 batch. The skill is the **greenfield** counterpart to `doc-align` — it runs when the user has an idea but no plan yet, with no dependency on `CONTEXT.md` or `docs/adr/`. It walks the decision tree one question at a time (never batched, never "and also…" hedges), prefers open-ended over yes/no questions, recaps the established branches every 3–5 turns in the same format used by `triage-issues` `needs-info` notes, and recognises tree resolution to stop without padding. The output is a confirmed intent summary ready to hand off to `doc-align` (validate against docs), `doc-prd` (package as a ticket), or `implement` (start immediately). This establishes the natural flow `interview → doc-align → doc-prd → implement` (establish → validate → package → execute). Registered in the `docs` bundle next to its siblings `doc-align`, `doc-prd`, `triage-issues`, and `scaffold-skill`. 📝 Roadmap updated with RM-084 in Cluster 14.

## [1.46.0] - 2026-05-19

✨ New `/octopus:map-system` slash command. The `map-system` skill (added in v1.45.0) is manual-invocation only by design — agents must not engage it autonomously from task signals — so until now the only trigger was natural-language phrasing like "zoom out" or "map this". The new command makes the invocation canonical and discoverable through the slash-command list alongside the other engineering process commands (`/octopus:doc-prd`, `/octopus:triage-issues`, `/octopus:prototype`, `/octopus:context-handoff`).

## [1.45.0] - 2026-05-19

✨ Nine new engineering process skills land under Cluster 14 (RM-075..083), adding the individual-developer process layer that frames how a developer — or an agent acting as one — makes decisions inside a single session. The `starter` bundle gains `test-tdd` (standalone red-green-refactor loop with an explicit ban on horizontal slicing), `map-system` (manual-invocation system map in domain vocabulary), `prototype` (throwaway code with a strict logic-vs-UI bifurcation gate and no persistence by default), and `context-handoff` (session compaction saved to the OS tmp dir, never the workspace, with mandatory secret redaction and a prescriptive "suggested next skills" section). The `docs` bundle gains `doc-align` (plan grilling against `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` with the ADR triple-gate enforced), `doc-prd` (synthesises the current conversation into a tracker-ready PRD without re-interviewing, forbidding file paths and code snippets in the body except for prototype-derived ones), `triage-issues` (state-machine triage with a mandatory AI disclaimer on every generated comment and rejected enhancements recorded in `.out-of-scope/`), and `scaffold-skill` (creates new skills end-to-end and **registers them into a bundle** as part of the same flow — no skill ships loose). The `quality` bundle gains `refactor-deepen`, which finds shallow-module deepening opportunities through the deletion test and a canonical Module/Seam/Adapter vocabulary. Four skills also ship explicit slash commands (`/octopus:doc-prd`, `/octopus:triage-issues`, `/octopus:prototype`, `/octopus:context-handoff`) and three skills (`refactor-deepen`, `prototype`, `scaffold-skill`) split distinct lookup sub-domains into `REFERENCE.md` next to the main `SKILL.md`. 📝 `docs/roadmap.md` adds Cluster 14 documenting all nine items with bundle assignment and the design pillars behind each one.

## [1.44.0] - 2026-05-16

✨ New `rules/typescript/ui-conventions.md` rule template for frontend projects. Codifies input mask conventions (CPF, CNPJ, phone, CEP, date, currency) so AI assistants always use the designated mask component and formatter helpers instead of generating raw `<input>` elements. Teams override with `.octopus/rules/typescript/ui-conventions.local.md` to supply their actual component names, mask patterns, import paths, and Zod schemas — delivered automatically via the existing `.local.md` symlink mechanism.

## [1.43.0] - 2026-05-16

✨ The `typecheck.sh` hook now injects type/build errors back into Claude's context so it self-corrects without manual intervention. Previously it only printed errors to the hooks panel (invisible to Claude). It now returns `{"decision": "block", "reason": "<errors>"}` — Claude Code feeds the reason back to Claude in the same turn, which then fixes the code automatically. Covers TypeScript (`tsc`), Python (`mypy`/`pyright`), and C# (`dotnet build`).

## [1.42.5] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed `typecheck.sh` not running `dotnet build` in .NET projects — the hook was calling `dotnet build` from the wrong directory, failing with MSB1003 (no project file found). Now applies the same `.sln`/`.csproj` walk-up discovery used in `auto-format.sh`. Claude Code will now see compilation errors (e.g., `void Foo()` without a body) after each edit and self-correct.

## [1.42.4] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed PostToolUse formatter hooks never running. The hooks were reading `file_path` from the top-level JSON, but Claude Code sends it inside `tool_input` — so the path was always empty and the hook exited silently without formatting anything. Also fixed `dotnet format --include` silently ignoring absolute paths when a project directory is specified; the hook now `cd`s into the project root and passes a relative path. Affected: `auto-format.sh`, `console-log-warn.sh`, `typecheck.sh`.

## [1.42.3] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed Stop hook error ("Failed with non-blocking status code") in projects that are not git repositories. `console-log-check.sh` called `git diff` inside a `set -euo pipefail` subshell — `git` exits 128 outside a repo, propagating as 129. Now exits 0 cleanly when no git repo is detected.

## [1.42.2] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed `dotnet format` not running in projects that have a `.csproj` but no `.sln`. The `auto-format.sh` project discovery used `compgen -G` with two patterns in one call — `compgen` only accepts one pattern, so `.csproj` files were never found. Now uses separate `compgen -G` calls for `.sln` and `.csproj`.

## [1.42.1] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed hooks and workflow not being enabled after running `octopus setup --reconfigure` with the fzf picker. Default-on features were reset to `false` before parsing fzf output — since fzf multi-select is opt-in, not toggling an item means "keep the default", not "disable it". Hooks and workflow now stay enabled unless explicitly toggled off.

📝 README pipeline examples updated to English only.

## [1.42.0] - 2026-05-16

✨ The `delegate` skill now supports **multi-step role pipelines**. A single message with multiple `@role:` mentions and sequencing language (PT-BR or EN: `após`, `then`, `after`, `ao final`, etc.) automatically enters pipeline mode. Octopus shows a plan preview, validates all roles before starting, executes each step with the previous outputs as context, and asks for confirmation at each gate. Roles joined by "e"/"and" are dispatched in parallel in a single turn. The `--auto` flag (or "rode tudo de uma vez") runs all steps without stopping. A role alias table resolves shorthands (`pm`, `staff-engineer`, `frontend-specialist`, `backend`, etc.) to their canonical names. Pre-flight validation reports missing roles with installation hints before any dispatch runs.

## [1.41.4] - 2026-05-16

🎨 All slash command descriptions now carry an `(Octopus)` prefix, making them easy to distinguish from other plugins in the Claude Code `/` menu.

## [1.41.3] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed slash commands showing no description in the `/` menu. The setup script was stripping the YAML frontmatter from command files before writing them — removing the `description:` field that Claude Code reads to populate the menu. Commands now include their full frontmatter.

## [1.41.2] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed SPACE not toggling items in the fzf picker — it was documented as a toggle key but never bound, so fzf used its default (cursor-down). SPACE and TAB now both toggle selection; TAB also advances the cursor and shift-TAB goes back. Removed an incorrect `--nth=1` flag that was limiting search scope. Picker height increased to 80% for better readability.

## [1.41.1] - 2026-05-16

🐛 Fixed `octopus update` not installing bundled fzf binaries. The installer was downloading the bare git archive (`archive/refs/tags/`) which contains only source files, not the fzf binaries built by CI. It now downloads the release asset (`releases/download/`) which includes `bin/fzf/` for all platforms. The release tarball is also restructured to include a versioned root directory (`octopus-<tag>/`) so the installer's extraction logic works correctly. After running `octopus update`, the fzf picker will appear automatically during `octopus setup`.

## [1.41.0] - 2026-05-16

✨ The setup picker now supports **multi-bundle selection**. In the bash fallback, entering `1, 3` or `1 2 3` selects multiple bundles; invalid numbers trigger a re-prompt with a clear error instead of silently defaulting to `starter`. The fzf picker (available after updating to v1.40.0+) collects all TAB-selected bundles rather than discarding extras. The `--bundle=` CLI flag also accepts comma-separated values (`--bundle=starter,docs`) for non-interactive setups. The generated `.octopus.yml` lists each selected bundle as a separate entry under `bundles:`.

## [1.40.0] - 2026-05-16

✨ This release delivers **Cluster 13 — Rules override consistency & formatter hooks**, a complete overhaul of how Octopus manages coding rules across assistants, teams, and developer environments.

✨ Rules now support a **four-layer override hierarchy**: Octopus defaults → workspace shared repo → personal `~/.octopus/rules/` → project `.octopus/rules/`. A new `workspace:` key in `.octopus.yml` lets teams point to a shared repository so organisation-wide standards propagate automatically to every project. Personal overrides in `~/.octopus/rules/` apply across all projects without committing anything to the repo.

✨ The symlink delivery mode now **picks up `.local.md` overrides immediately** — no `octopus update` required after creating an override file. For agents using concatenate mode (Gemini), `post-merge` and `post-checkout` git hooks detect `.local.md` changes after a pull or branch switch and re-run setup automatically.

✨ **Copilot and Codex** manifests were updated to `native_rules: true`. Copilot rules are now symlinked to `.github/instructions/` as `.instructions.md` files; Codex rules land in `.codex/rules/`. Both agents also receive an auto-generated "Coding Rules" section in their main config file pointing to the correct paths, matching the behaviour Claude already had via template injection.

✨ A new `rules/csharp/coding-style.md` preset ships with Octopus, covering the Allman brace convention, `var` usage, null handling, and expression bodies. All rule files in `rules/csharp/` and `rules/common/` now carry an `Override:` or `Extend-only:` header so teams know exactly what they can customise.

🔧 **Formatter hooks** are now bundle-aware: `deliver_hooks` filters hooks tagged with a `stacks` field against `OCTOPUS_RULES`, so TypeScript-only hooks like `console-log-warn` are not injected for C#-only projects. Teams can override any default formatter by providing `.octopus/hooks/hooks.local.json`. The `auto-format.sh` dotnet handler was also improved to discover the nearest `.sln`/`.csproj` and pass `--no-restore`.

📝 The roadmap was updated to record all eight RM entries (RM-067–074) as completed.

## [1.39.0] - 2026-05-12

✨ This release replaces the TUI setup wizard with `setup-picker.sh`, a single-screen selector that uses fzf (now bundled in the release tarball) or a plain bash fallback — no whiptail, no dialog, no ncurses windows. `octopus setup` is now flag-first: `--bundle`, `--scope`, `--stack`, `--no-hooks`, and `--no-workflow` deliver everything without interaction; non-interactive environments (CI/pipe) fall back to silent defaults.

♻️ Bundles have been reorganized by team intent instead of tech stack. The new `docs`, `quality`, and `backend` bundles replace `documentation`, `saas-quality`, `quality-leadership`, `dotnet-api`, `node-api`, and `fullstack`. Stack-specific content (.NET, TypeScript) moved to the `--stack` flag. The `setup.sh` delivery output was also compacted: one `✓` line per group instead of banners and KV tables.

🚀 fzf binaries are now downloaded at release build time for linux-amd64, linux-arm64, darwin-amd64, darwin-arm64, and windows-amd64, ensuring the picker works without external dependencies.

📝 RM-065 (`frontend` bundle) and RM-066 (`fullstack` bundle) added to the roadmap for future tracking.

## [1.38.1] - 2026-05-10

🐛 Fixed the `SessionStart` hook (`load-context.sh`) silently exiting with a non-zero code on every session start. The script used `set -euo pipefail`, causing `grep` to abort the script when `.octopus.yml` had no `knowledge_dir:` key or the knowledge `INDEX.md` had no active modules — both common conditions. The `-e` flag has been removed and `|| true` added to the affected pipelines. A secondary bug in dotnet detection (`[[ -f "*.sln" ]]` never matches globs) was also fixed.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-05-10

✨ This release introduces the **delegate skill** — a new way to dispatch tasks to Octopus roles without leaving the active harness session. Typing `@backend-developer: add endpoint X` in any conversation causes the orchestrating agent to forward the task to that role and return the result inline with attribution (`» <role> respondeu:`). The same flow is available as a slash command via `/octopus:delegate @<role> <task>`.

🐛 Two refinement passes followed the initial implementation: an overly broad `@`-keyword trigger that fired on emails, GitHub handles, and decorators was removed from the skill's frontmatter, and harness detection was rewritten to check `Agent` tool availability rather than harness name — making the skill genuinely harness-agnostic. The command file's Instructions section was also corrected to follow the "The skill owns the full workflow — do not reinterpret it here" pattern used by peer commands, eliminating duplicated parsing logic.

🔧 The `delegate` skill has been added to the `starter` bundle so new and existing projects receive it automatically on the next `setup.sh` run.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-04-27

✨ A new `content-images` skill generalizes the image generation pattern into a reusable Octopus capability. The skill generates brand-consistent images for blog covers (OG 1200×630), Instagram feed posts (1080×1080), and carousels using Google Gemini Imagen — with Pollinations.ai as a free fallback when no API key is available. Brand context is read from a per-project `.octopus/content-images.json` preset; the `GEMINI_API_KEY` is resolved from `.env.octopus`. Generation is cached by output file path and respects a `--force` flag for regeneration. The `social-media` agent gains a Phase 4.5 (Image Asset Protocol) that prompts the user to generate visual assets at the end of every content session. The skill is added to the `growth` bundle alongside `launch-feature` and `launch-release`.

## [1.36.1] - 2026-04-26

🐛 Fixed the Octopus Control dispatch UX. The fragile double-click detection (timing guard via Textual's `RowHighlighted` + `RowSelected` events) that never worked reliably has been removed. Pressing `[a]` now pre-fills the command bar with `@<role>: ` when an agent row is highlighted — delivering the intended UX without mouse event complexity. The `on_input_changed` toaster that interrupted typing by showing "Pipeline mode: press [p]" whenever the user typed `@` has also been removed.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-04-25

✨ A new `/octopus:commit` slash command is now available, providing a lightweight way to commit changes without following the full development workflow. The command reads the staged diff, resolves language configuration the same way `pr-open` does, detects tracker references (RM-NNN, Jira IDs, GitHub issues) and includes them in the commit footer, and warns when the diff spans multiple unrelated logical contexts. Every generated commit automatically includes a `Co-authored-by: octopus[bot]` trailer to mark tool participation. The commit conventions documentation was updated to document this new trailer and clarify its distinction from AI assistant trailers.

## [1.35.0] - 2026-04-25

✨ `octopus update` now automatically re-runs `octopus setup` after installing a new release, so agent configs (commands, skills, rules) are always regenerated to reflect the new version. If setup fails — for example when downgrading to an older release that predates the setup command — a warning is printed and the update still succeeds. If no `.octopus.yml` is found in the project tree, setup is skipped with a clear message. A new `commands/update.md` template was added so the `/octopus:update` slash command is properly delivered by setup going forward.

## [1.34.0] - 2026-04-25

♻️ This release delivers a complete rebranding of all roles, skills, and bundles to eliminate naming inconsistencies and clarify the boundaries between who an agent is (roles) and what it does (skills).

**Roles** now use short job titles: `backend-specialist` → `backend-developer`, `frontend-specialist` → `frontend-developer`, `tech-writer` → `writer`, `social-media` → `marketer`, `staff-engineer` → `architect`. A new `architect` role covers system design review and quality gates.

**Skills** were reorganized under category prefixes: the `audit-*` group covers pre-merge quality checks (`audit-money`, `audit-security`, `audit-tenant`); `doc-*` groups documentation skills (`doc-adr`, `doc-lifecycle`, `doc-design`, `doc-plan`); `review-*` covers code review processes (`review-pr`, `review-contracts`); and `launch-*` covers go-to-market publishing (`launch-feature`, `launch-release`). Several skills also received shorter names: `debugging` → `debug`, `plan-backlog-hygiene` → `plan-backlog`, `e2e-testing` → `test-e2e`.

**Bundles** were renamed to plain-English team situations: `quality-gates` → `saas-quality`, `docs-discipline` → `documentation`, `cross-stack` → `fullstack`. A new `quality-leadership` bundle was added for the `architect` role. All bundle YAML files, the setup wizard, README, and `.octopus.example.yml` were updated accordingly. 📝

This release also includes 🐛 two control panel fixes: the known roles list now reloads on every poll cycle (fixing the missing agent issue), and double-click in the agent roster now opens the command bar pre-filled with the selected role.

## [1.33.3] - 2026-04-25

🐛 Fixed double-click on agent — definitive fix after three failed attempts.

**Root cause (two layers):** (1) Textual's `DataTable._on_click` calls `event.stop()`, so `Click` events never reach the App-level `on_click` handler — all three previous attempts were targeting an event that simply never arrived. (2) `_refresh_roster()` calls `table.clear()` every 0.3s, resetting DataTable's internal state so `RowSelected` never fires via mouse (only via Enter key).

**Fix:** Double-click is now detected by timing two consecutive `RowHighlighted` events for the same role within 400ms. A `_refreshing_roster` flag prevents the programmatic cursor restore inside `_refresh_roster()` from triggering false positives. Extracted `_open_command_for_role()` helper is shared between the double-click handler and `action_add_task`.

## [1.33.2] - 2026-04-25

🐛 Fixed crash on double-click in the agents roster. Textual uses `event.chain` (not `event.count`) for click repetition count — the v1.33.1 fix crashed on the first click. Now reads `chain` with a fallback to `count` for forward compatibility.

## [1.33.1] - 2026-04-25

🐛 Two fixes in this patch.

**Double-click on agent now works** — the previous implementation used `DataTable.RowSelected`, which only fires on Enter, not on mouse double-click. Replaced with `on_click` + `event.count >= 2` for proper double-click detection.

**`octopus update` always fetches the latest installer** — the update shim was reusing the cached version's `install.sh` (which could have the old banner or other outdated behavior). It now fetches `install.sh` fresh from GitHub `main` before each update, falling back to the cached copy only if the network request fails.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-04-25

Three polish improvements across the installer and `octopus control`.

✨ **Double-click to delegate** — double-clicking (or pressing Enter) on any agent in the roster now opens the command bar pre-filled with `@role: `, ready to type a task. This mirrors the `a` keybind but is more discoverable for mouse users.

🎨 **Installer banner removed** — the large ASCII art octopus at the start of `install.sh` has been replaced with a clean `🐙 OCTOPUS CLI Installer` one-liner. Faster to read, friendlier in narrow terminals and CI logs.

🐛 **Agents panel wider** — the roster column grew from 38 to 52 characters wide (minimum 38), eliminating the horizontal scrollbar that appeared when agent status lines were long.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-04-25

✨ **Natural language pipeline builder** — the biggest addition this release. Press `[p]` in `octopus control` to open an interactive pipeline builder directly in the TUI. Define multi-agent workflows visually: each step shows the agent, a wait toggle, and the task prompt. Navigate with `j/k`, add steps with `a`, delete with `d`, toggle approval gates with `w`, and confirm the pipeline with `p`.

✨ **NL pre-fill from `@mentions`** — type a description with `@role-name` mentions in the command bar before pressing `[p]` and the builder opens pre-populated. The parser detects review verbs (`review`, `valide`, `approve`, `aprova`…) and automatically sets `wait=true` on those steps, infers parallel tiers from connectors like `e`, `and`, `em paralelo`, and flags ambiguous steps in yellow for manual correction.

✨ **`@system` steps** — pipelines can now include `@system` steps that execute shell scripts instead of launching a Claude Code agent. The built-in `merge_to_develop` action is available out of the box; custom actions can be defined in `.octopus/system_actions.yml`. Undefined actions raise an error before execution; failed system steps pause the pipeline with a clear message.

✨ **`staff-engineer` role** — new role for architecture review and senior code review. Uses the `opus` model by default. Classifies findings as `BLOCKING`, `ADVISORY`, or `QUESTION`, validates against ADRs, and only approves when correctness, security, architecture, and test coverage all pass.

📝 The spec for the natural language pipeline builder is documented in `docs/specs/nl-pipeline-builder.md`. ♻️ Minor cleanup: inline imports in `app.py` moved to module level.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-04-25

This release closes the seven items in Cluster 11 — Control reliability & ergonomics. ✨

**Cancel and retry tasks directly in the TUI** — two new keybindings make queue management frictionless: `x` cancels a selected `queued` task before it runs, and `e` re-enqueues a `failed` or `done` task without leaving the dashboard.

**Terminal bell + desktop notification on agent completion** — when an agent finishes or fails, `octopus control` now emits a terminal bell (`\a`) and attempts a desktop notification via `notify-send` (Linux) or `osascript` (macOS), so you can step away while tasks run.

**`--model` flag in the TUI command bar** — any inline command now accepts `--model opus|sonnet|haiku` (or a full model ID). The flag is stripped before routing to the skill matcher and applies to both new tasks and session replies (`↩ role:`).

**`octopus ask --reply`** — continue an existing agent session from the CLI without opening the TUI: `octopus ask tech-writer --reply "yes, proceed"`. Streams the response live, identical to a fresh `octopus ask`.

✨ **Per-task log files** — agent logs are now named `<role>-<task-id>.log` with a `<role>.log` symlink pointing to the latest, so historical task output is no longer overwritten when a role is reused.

**Daemon mode** — `octopus control --daemon start` runs the dispatch loop headlessly (no Textual UI), enabling CI pipelines and long overnight runs. `--daemon stop` sends SIGTERM via `.octopus/daemon.pid`; `--daemon status` checks liveness.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-04-24

You can now dispatch multiple tasks to the same agent. ✨

**Multi-task queue per agent** — pressing `a` on any agent (busy or idle) now prefills `@role:` in the command bar, making it frictionless to queue additional tasks while one is already running. The dispatch engine already executed tasks sequentially; only the UX was missing.

**`+N queued` badge in roster** — agents with pending tasks show a dim badge (e.g. `+2 queued`) next to their status in the roster, so you can see the backlog at a glance without opening the queue panel.

## [1.29.1] - 2026-04-24

🐛 Fixed spinner continuing to run after an agent finishes. Completed `claude` processes were becoming zombies — `os.kill(pid, 0)` on a zombie succeeds, so the TUI incorrectly treated them as still running. The reap check now calls `proc.poll()` first, which triggers `waitpid()` and properly reaps the zombie, returning the exit code. `os.kill` is only used as a fallback for adopted orphan processes.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-04-24

Two improvements to the agent reply experience in `octopus control`. ✨

**Reply visible in Output panel** — when you send a reply to an agent via `r`, your message now appears in the log before the agent's response, formatted as `── you ──` / `── agent ──` separators. Previously only the agent's output was recorded.

**"Awaiting reply" status in roster** — agents that have finished and are waiting for user input now show `↩ awaiting reply` in amber instead of continuing to spin. The roster now has three distinct states: spinner for actively running agents, amber `↩ awaiting reply` for agents with an open session, and dim `○ idle` for free agents.

## [1.28.3] - 2026-04-24

🐛 The Output panel now occupies half the screen height instead of a fixed 12 lines. Previously the queue took two-thirds of the right column while the log viewer was too small to be useful. Queue and schedule now split their area equally, and the Output panel grows with the terminal size.

## [1.28.2] - 2026-04-24

🐛 Fixed flag name for skipping permission prompts in agent launches — `--dangerouslySkipPermissions` (camelCase) was corrected to `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (kebab-case), which is the actual flag accepted by the Claude CLI.

## [1.28.1] - 2026-04-24

🐛 Agents launched by `octopus control` and `octopus ask` no longer prompt for permission before writing files. Running non-interactively via `--print`, these dialogs had no way to be approved through the normal UI — agents would stall and output instructions asking the user to manually approve each write. The `--dangerouslySkipPermissions` flag is now passed at launch time; the destructive-guard hook remains as the safety layer for genuinely dangerous operations.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-04-24

This release improves the `octopus control` dashboard with animated feedback and several usability fixes. ✨

**Animated queue spinner** — running tasks in the queue panel now display an animated braille spinner (⠋⠙⠹…) instead of a static ●, making it immediately clear that an agent is actively working. A dedicated 0.3s timer drives the animation independently from the 2s poll that handles log reads and process checks, so the TUI stays responsive without extra I/O overhead.

🐛 **Output panel stays pinned to selected agent** — clicking between agents in the roster now correctly updates the Output panel to the selected agent's log. Previously, the 0.3s roster refresh was clearing and rebuilding the DataTable, losing the cursor position and resetting the output to whichever agent landed on row 0.

🐛 **Reply input no longer selects prefilled text** — pressing `r` to reply to an agent prefills the command bar with `↩ role:`, but focus processing was causing the text to appear selected, so the first keystroke would erase it. The prefill is now applied after focus completes, so you can type immediately without losing the prefix.

## [1.27.1] - 2026-04-24

This patch release fixes two `octopus control` reliability issues. 🐛

**Stuck "running" tasks** — tasks whose processes had died were left indefinitely in the queue with a "running" status, making `Ctrl+D` cleanup ineffective. The TUI now reconciles process state against the queue on startup and before every cleanup sweep, so stale entries are correctly transitioned to "done" or "failed".

**Empty agents roster** — opening `octopus control` showed no agents unless at least one was already running. The roster now loads all roles configured in `.claude/agents/` at startup and displays them as idle, giving you the full picture from the moment the dashboard opens.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-04-24

✨ **Agent reply — bidirectional interaction via session resume**

Agents launched by `octopus control` and `octopus ask` can now be replied to, enabling multi-turn conversations without restarting a task.

Under the hood, agents now run with `--output-format=stream-json --verbose`. A background parser thread reads the JSONL output, extracts the `session_id` from the first event, and writes it to `.octopus/sessions/<role>.session`. Plain text is still written to the log as before, so streaming and the Output panel are unaffected.

A new `[r]eply` keybinding in the TUI opens the command bar pre-filled with `↩ <role>: ` when the selected agent has a resumable session. Submitting the reply calls `launch_resume()`, which runs `claude --resume <session_id> --print "<reply>"` and appends the new turn to the existing log with a `── reply ──` separator. The Output panel streams the resumed session live. Multiple back-and-forth turns are supported — each turn captures a new `session_id`. Agents with a resumable session show a subtle `↩` indicator in the roster.

`octopus ask` prints the session file path at the end of every run so users know a TUI reply is available without opening the dashboard.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-04-24

✨ **Control & Run UX overhaul — `octopus ask`, `@role:` delegation, mini-feed, pipeline progress**

The `octopus control` and `octopus run` experience is now significantly more usable with six targeted UX improvements.

A new `octopus ask <role> "task"` command provides terminal-first delegation: it launches a specific agent and streams its log to stdout in real time, printing timestamps on each output line and a `✓ done` / `✗ failed` summary with elapsed time at the end. `Ctrl+C` during streaming prompts `[k]ill  [d]etach  [c]ancel` so agents can be detached to run in the background and later picked up by `octopus control`.

The TUI command bar now understands `@role:` prefix syntax — typing `@tech-writer: write the ADR` routes the task to the correct agent regardless of cursor position. Selecting an idle agent in the roster and pressing `a` (or Enter) pre-fills `@<role>: ` in the command bar so delegation is a single gesture. The agents roster now shows the last line of each agent's log inline, dimmed, so users can monitor all parallel agents at a glance without switching the output panel. Navigating the agents table with arrow keys now updates the Output panel to that agent's full log in real time.

✨ `pipeline.py` now emits structured progress lines throughout execution — `→ id  agent  body` on task start, `✓/✗ id  agent  Ns` on completion, and a final `✓/✗ pipeline done  Ns` summary — so `octopus run` gives live per-task feedback instead of silence.

🔧 A named constant `_LOG_WAIT_POLL` was extracted and a missing-log guard was added to `ask.py` to handle the case where an agent fails to start.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-04-23

✨ **Pipeline runner — `octopus run`, DAG executor, and control UI overhaul**

The centerpiece of this release is the end-to-end pipeline runner: starting from a requirement in any form (free text, GitHub issue, or existing spec), Octopus now orchestrates multiple agents in parallel all the way to an automatically opened PR. The new `octopus run` command serves as a unified entry point, chaining `doc-research → doc-plan → execution → review gate → PR` without manual intervention between steps.

The execution core lives in `cli/control/pipeline.py`, which reads the new enriched plan format — a `pipeline:` YAML frontmatter block with per-task `agent` and `depends_on` fields — and builds a dependency graph (DAG). Tasks with no shared dependencies run in parallel in isolated git worktrees; dependent tasks wait for their predecessors to finish. Plan checkboxes are ticked in real time as tasks complete, and a reviewer agent is dispatched automatically when `review_skill` is configured. The `octopus control --plan <file>` flag exposes the runner non-interactively with `--dry-run` support.

`/octopus:doc-plan` gained a Step 3b that auto-generates the pipeline frontmatter, inferring the responsible agent from task keywords (migration/endpoint/API → `backend-specialist`, component/UI/form → `frontend-specialist`, doc/README/ADR → `tech-writer`, review/audit → `reviewer`) and the dependency chain between tasks. The `plan-skeleton.md` template was updated to include the `pipeline:` block by default.

🎨 The `octopus control` TUI received a full visual overhaul: the PID column was replaced by elapsed time with a spinner (e.g. `⠙ 2m34s`); all panel borders now show dynamic titles (`Agents`, `Queue  2 running · 1 waiting`, `Output · backend-specialist · live`); layout proportions were corrected (queue `2fr`, schedule `1fr`); background darkened to `#080c14` with visible but subtle borders; the 🐙 emoji was added to the window title. 🐛 The redundant ID column was removed from the Schedule panel.

🔧 `.worktrees/` was added to `.gitignore` to support the worktree isolation system.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-04-23

✨ This release completes the `octopus control` TUI dashboard with the UX and correctness gaps identified during first real use (RM-045 to RM-052).

The log panel now uses a scrollable `RichLog` widget that streams all agent output in real time — replacing the single-line `Label` that showed only the last line. The agent roster gains an animated spinner to visually confirm that a process is alive. Selecting a completed or failed task in the queue list loads its full log from disk into the same panel, making post-run inspection straightforward.

Skill discovery in the command bar is now driven by `SuggestFromList` typeahead: typing `/` filters available skills inline. Ambiguous natural-language matches surface a warning instead of silently dispatching to the wrong skill; single-match NL hits show the resolved skill in the input for confirmation before enqueue.

On the correctness side, `ProcessManager` now stores `Popen` objects and exposes `exit_code()` via `poll()`. Dead agents are marked `done` or `failed` based on their actual exit code rather than always assumed successful. The `Scheduler` thread — previously defined but never instantiated — is now wired into `on_mount` and dispatches tasks whenever a `.octopus/schedule.yml` entry fires. Queue cleanup lands as `TaskQueue.cleanup(keep_last)`, running automatically every 30 polling ticks and exposed as `Ctrl+D` for manual use. The `worktrees/` directory that `ProcessManager` created at startup but never used is now backed by working `create_worktree` / `remove_worktree` helpers; `launch(isolate=True)` runs agents in a dedicated git worktree and cleans it up on reap.

📝 The gap analysis that prompted these changes is documented in `docs/research/2026-04-23-octopus-control-gaps.md`.

## [1.23.3] - 2026-04-22

🐛 Fixes slash commands in `octopus control` being sent with the wrong format. `_build_prompt` was reading key `"raw_prompt"` (which doesn't exist in the queue JSON) instead of `"prompt"`, and was building `/security-scan` instead of `/octopus:security-scan` — the namespace Claude Code uses for installed Octopus commands. Both bugs meant queued skill tasks ran without the skill context.

## [1.23.2] - 2026-04-22

🐛 Fixes three bugs that made `octopus control` non-functional after opening:

Tasks submitted via the command bar were enqueued but never executed — the TUI had no dispatch loop connecting the queue to `ProcessManager.launch()`. A `_poll()` method now runs every 2 seconds, dispatching the next queued task per role, reaping finished PIDs, and refreshing the roster and queue panels automatically.

The async log tailer had no `await asyncio.sleep()`, causing it to busy-loop and block Textual's event loop entirely. The replacement `_stream_log()` coroutine waits 200 ms between empty reads and stops tailing once the agent process exits.

`SkillMatcher` was pointed at `.octopus/skills/` (which does not exist) instead of `.claude/skills/` where Octopus installs skills. Slash commands still work without this fix, but natural-language keyword matching was silently producing an empty catalog.

## [1.23.1] - 2026-04-22

🐛 Fixes `octopus control` failing with `No module named 'cli'` when invoked outside the repository root. The fix sets `PYTHONPATH` to the parent of `CLI_DIR` before launching `python3 -m cli.control.app`, so module resolution works correctly regardless of the current working directory.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-04-22

✨ This release delivers **RM-044 — `octopus control`**, a self-contained TUI dashboard (Python/textual) that lets a single developer orchestrate multiple Claude Code agent sessions locally without external infrastructure.

The new `octopus control` subcommand opens a four-panel terminal UI: an **AgentRoster** that polls running agent PIDs every second and adopts orphaned sessions on startup; a **TaskQueue** backed by JSON files under `.octopus/queue/` with nanosecond-precision IDs for collision-free concurrent writes; a **SchedulePanel** driven by a background cron thread that reads `.octopus/schedule.yml` and fires tasks on `daily HH:MM` or weekday rules; and an **OutputPanel** that tails agent log files asynchronously. A command bar (bound to `a`) accepts both slash commands (`/security-scan src/auth/`) and natural-language prompts, resolved to a skill and model by the new `SkillMatcher` — which reads skill frontmatter and respects per-skill model overrides over the role default. Pressing `q` with agents running prompts a `stop / detach / cancel` choice so sessions are never silently killed. The UI is styled with the Octopus palette (`#7B2FBE` accent, `#00B4D8` ocean, `#1a1a2e` background) and panel focus borders.

The process manager launches Claude Code as a subprocess in an isolated git worktree under `.octopus/worktrees/<role>/`, writes a PID file, and streams output to a per-role log. Fifteen new tests cover the full stack: `bash tests/test_control.sh` exercises CLI routing and the integration path for `adopt_orphans`; `pytest` covers launch/kill, queue ops, cron firing, and all skill-matcher branches including ambiguous NL input and empty strings.

🐛 The hook delivery system was hardened: `deliver_hooks()` now merges by hook `id` instead of replacing the full array, so re-running `octopus setup` no longer clobbers manually added hooks. ✨ Eight additional skills (`audit-all`, `backend-patterns`, `batch`, `compress-skill`, `continuous-learning`, `feature-to-market`, `plan-backlog-hygiene`, `release-announce`) gained `triggers:` frontmatter, completing lazy activation coverage. 🔧 A `--dry-run` mode was added to `octopus setup` — every `deliver_*()` function checks `OCTOPUS_DRY_RUN` and prints what it would do without touching the filesystem, backed by 16 test cases.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-04-22

✨ This release closes three roadmap items that together make Octopus audits faster and more automatic.

The audit pipeline gains a **content-keyed output cache** (RM-026): each run hashes the scoped diff against the skill's own SKILL.md, stores the result under `.octopus/cache/<skill>/<key>.md`, and replays it instantly on re-runs without calling the LLM. The shared protocol lives in `skills/_shared/audit-cache.md` and is referenced by all four audit skills. A `.gitignore` guard is applied automatically so cache files are never committed.

The Full-mode setup wizard now shows a **skill impact table** before the user confirms their selection (RM-027): the new `_skill_impact_table()` helper in `setup-wizard.sh` reads `wc -l` from each skill's SKILL.md and displays lines and an estimated token count (~4 tokens/line), making the cost of a selection visible upfront.

✨ A new advisory **pre-push git hook** (RM-029) rounds out the release. `cli/lib/audit-map.sh` is a pure bash library that parses the patterns.md cascade for each audit skill — path tokens tested against changed file paths, content regexes tested against added/removed lines — and emits the matched audit names in criticality order. `hooks/git/pre-push-audit-suggest.sh` uses this library to print a suggestion blocklet before every push, listing which Octopus audits the diff is likely to need. The hook is installed by `octopus setup` when `workflow: true` and at least one audit skill is present; it is advisory only, never blocks, and can be skipped with `OCTOPUS_SKIP_AUDIT_HOOK=1` or disabled repo-wide with `postMergeAuditHook: false` in `.octopus.yml`. Chain-mode preserves any pre-existing `pre-push` hook. The `patterns.md` files for `money-review`, `tenant-scope-audit`, and the newly created `security-scan` were migrated to the standard `## Path tokens` / `## Content regex` schema the library expects.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-04-22

✨ This release ships **RM-025 — Pre-LLM Audit Pass**, completing the token-reduction arc started in v1.20.0. All four audit skills (`money-review`, `security-scan`, `cross-stack-contract`, `tenant-scope-audit`) now run a deterministic grep phase before handing the diff to the LLM. A new shared fragment `skills/_shared/audit-pre-pass.md` defines the four-step protocol: filter candidate files from `git diff --name-only`, exit early if none match, apply an optional line-level filter, and produce a scoped diff containing only relevant files.

Each skill declares its domain patterns via a new `pre_pass:` frontmatter block alongside `triggers:`. On PRs with no relevant files the skill exits immediately with "no changes detected", avoiding any LLM call. 📝 The spec was published separately in PR #73 before implementation, following the doc-design → doc-plan → implement workflow.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-04-22

✨ This release ships **RM-022 — Lazy Skill Activation**, the first item
from Cluster 1 (Reduce tokens loaded per session). A new `triggers:`
frontmatter block in `SKILL.md` lets each skill declare when it is
relevant — by file paths, keywords, or manifest tools. When
`octopus setup` generates a concatenated agent output (Copilot, Codex,
Gemini, OpenCode), skills whose triggers don't match the project are
replaced with a compact 3-line stub instead of their full content. Skills
without a `triggers:` block are always included in full, preserving
complete backward compatibility.

Six domain-specific skills ship with trigger annotations out of the box:
`e2e-testing`, `dotnet`, and `cross-stack-contract` activate on file
paths (spec files, `.csproj`, OpenAPI docs); `security-scan`,
`money-review`, and `tenant-scope-audit` activate on keywords in README
and project metadata. Dog-food against this repo (bash/markdown, no
framework code) measured −1,326 lines saved across the 6 guarded skills,
exceeding the RM-022 target of ≥ 40% reduction in output size for
typical projects.

📝 A completed design spec for RM-022 was added to `docs/specs/` via
`/octopus:doc-design`.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-21

This release completes **Cluster 5**, bringing the full spec-design → plan →
execute workflow natively into Octopus — no external `superpowers` plugin
required for the design loop.

✨ Three new slash commands land in this release. `/octopus:doc-design` opens
an interactive spec-design session that walks through Design, Implementation
Plan, Testing Strategy, and adaptive sections (Non-Goals, Risks, Migration)
via a one-question-at-a-time conversation, finishing with a self-review pass
and an automatic docs-only branch commit. `/octopus:doc-plan` reads a
completed spec and writes a `docs/plans/<slug>.md` plan file using
bite-sized, TDD-style tasks with adaptive decomposition heuristics ("too big"
and "too small" guards) and a 15-task split warning. `/octopus:implement`
gains a `--plan PATH` walker mode that executes a plan file task-by-task:
it dispatches the existing single-task TDD loop per task, flips each task's
checkboxes in place after the commit (strategy documented in
`docs/adr/001-plan-walker-checkbox-commit.md`), and pauses for human review
between tasks with a `Continue / stop / redo-current` prompt. A
`--resume-from TaskN` flag allows picking up an interrupted session.
HARD-GATE: the walker never pushes, never opens PRs, never creates branches.

🐛 A fix to `/octopus:doc-design` clarifies the HARD-GATE wording (docs-only
branches are explicitly permitted) and adds automatic docs-only branch
creation when the session starts on `main` or `master`, preventing accidental
spec commits directly to the main branch.

📝 Design sessions produced specs for two upcoming Cluster 3 items:
bundle-diff-preview (RM-027, wizard impact annotations) and
post-merge-audit-hook (RM-029, post-push audit suggestions) — both spec-only,
no implementation yet.

🔧 The install banner was trimmed from 19 to 12 rows for a less intrusive
first-run experience.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-04-20

✨ `/octopus:pr-open` gained three polish items on top of the earlier redesign. Every section heading now carries an emoji for scanability — `📦 What`, `💡 Why`, `✅ Test plan`, `🔗 References`, `📂 Files changed`. The agent scans branch names, commits, and diffs for roadmap IDs (`RM-NNN`), Jira-style trackers (`[A-Z]{2,}-\d+` with a deny-list for HTTP codes and ISO standards), Notion and GitHub URLs, and local `docs/specs/*.md` / `docs/adr/*.md` paths, surfacing hits in a new conditional `🔗 References` section. The CLI now accepts `--title <string>`; when the agent supplies a human-friendly title prefixed with a type emoji (`🐛 Fix: …`, `✨ Feat: …`, …), it replaces the old branch-derived `feat: foo` title.

🐛 `octopus update` without flags now prefers the latest remote release instead of re-installing whatever is already cached. The previous resolver fell back to `metadata.json` — which records the *currently installed* version, not the update target — so the command silently became a no-op. The new `resolve_update_target()` keeps lockfile pinning as the top priority but skips metadata, going straight to the GitHub API and falling back only to `git describe`. The `"Resolving latest version…"` banner now prints only on the remote path; lockfile resolution says so explicitly.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-04-20

✨ PR descriptions are now written by the agent, not scraped by shell. `/octopus:pr-open` drives the agent to synthesise a three-section body — **What / Why / Test plan** — with the file list collapsed and a fixed `🐙 generated by Octopus` footer. The previous `generate_pr_body` heuristic (which dumped every commit, listed every file, and surfaced nonsense "Key Changes" from regex-matched identifier names) is gone. `cli/lib/pr-open.sh` shrank to ~40 lines of mechanics and now requires `--body-file`.

♻️ Manifest schema correction: in `.octopus.yml`, commit messages and PR descriptions move from `language.docs` to `language.code`. `docs` scope is now restricted to prose artefacts (specs, ADRs, RFCs, README). Field names are unchanged — only the semantic boundary moves. Teams using the short form `language: <code>` are unaffected.

✨ `octopus release commit-changelog` gained a fourth README sync pattern: `--version vX.Y.Z` install examples are now updated automatically alongside the version badge and manual-update snippets.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-04-20

✨ New `/octopus:compress-skill` command — shrinks a `SKILL.md` by ~25% without changing its meaning. A deterministic cleanup pass runs first (collapses blank runs, strips meta prose, shortens example lists); the LLM rewrite pass only fires when the target is not met. Invariants are enforced after each step: frontmatter stays byte-identical, every string the skill's test file greps for is preserved, headings are untouched, and fenced code blocks are copied verbatim. Dry-run is the default; `--apply` writes the result. Registered in the `docs-discipline` bundle and the setup wizard.

♻️ Refactored the three pre-merge audit skills (`money-review`, `tenant-scope-audit`, `cross-stack-contract`) to share conventions via `skills/_shared/audit-output-format.md`. Severity format, override cascade, `--write-report` frontmatter, and common errors now live in one file; each SKILL.md keeps only its skill-specific content. Tests were updated to look for conventions across both the skill file and the shared fragment.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-04-20

✨ The `auto-format` PostToolUse hook gained lint-fix capabilities alongside formatting — TS/JS now runs `biome check --write`, which also organizes imports and applies safe lint fixes, with a fallback to `eslint --fix` + `prettier`. On the .NET side, the hook now prefers **CSharpier** when available and falls back to `dotnet format --include` as before. Formatter failures are surfaced as a single-line message on stderr without blocking the hook. File-extension coverage was expanded to include `mjs`, `cjs`, `jsonc`, and `csx`.

✨ The `release-announce` skill received a Cagan-style refinement covering intent, FBE, and narrative.

## [1.14.5] - 2026-04-20

🎨 Install banner now renders a filled-silhouette octopus in coral (ANSI 210) — round head with two eye holes, geometric smile, two side arms and a fringe of bottom tentacles. 19 rows × 50 cols of `M`-pixel art, every row centered on col 24.5.

## [1.14.4] - 2026-04-20

🎨 Install banner now uses a reddish palette: coral head with bright-yellow eyes and a white smile on top, tentacles fading from dark red to deep red as they curl outward, and a bold-coral `OCTOPUS` title below. Uses 256-color ANSI escapes (terminals that lack 256-color support render the glyphs in the default foreground — still a recognizable octopus).

## [1.14.3] - 2026-04-20

✨ New ASCII-art banner for `install.sh`. The previous design (tiny head + stacked `|` lines as tentacles) read more like a broom than an octopus. Replaced with a recognizable octopus — domed head with eyes and mouth, three curling tentacles on each side — kept in green via the existing color scheme. Rendering switched from seven `echo -e` calls to a `cat <<'BANNER'` heredoc wrapped in `printf '%b'` for the color codes, so the literal art is easier to read and edit in source.

## [1.14.2] - 2026-04-20

🐛 Fixes missing descriptions for 10 slash commands in Claude Code's `/` list: `/octopus:implement`, `/octopus:debugging`, `/octopus:receiving-code-review`, `/octopus:audit-all`, `/octopus:cross-stack-contract`, `/octopus:money-review`, `/octopus:tenant-scope-audit`, `/octopus:plan-backlog-hygiene`, `/octopus:feature-to-market`, `/octopus:release-announce`. The command templates should ship with **two** frontmatter blocks — an outer Octopus metadata block (stripped at delivery) and an inner Claude-readable block (`description:` + `agent:`, preserved). The newer commands were authored with only the outer block, so `strip_frontmatter` removed the entire header and the delivered files had no description for Claude Code to render.

🧪 New `Test 1b` in `tests/test_workflow_commands.sh` asserts every delivered command starts with a frontmatter block containing a `description:` line, preventing this drift on future command additions.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-04-20

🐛 Fixes a silent install regression where `octopus install --latest` and `octopus update --latest` would stamp the new version's name over the current `RELEASE_ROOT` via a symlink — so `~/.octopus-cli/cache/v1.14.0` could end up pointing to a v1.8.0 tree, and `octopus setup` would silently deliver the old command/skill set. The shim's `install_release` now detects the mismatch: when `RELEASE_ROOT`'s git tag doesn't match the requested version, it delegates to `install.sh` (either the one bundled in the release tree or a fresh copy fetched from GitHub) with a new `--no-shim-setup` flag that runs the download/extract path without touching the running shim. Self-install bootstrap (the dev-checkout case where `RELEASE_ROOT == target`) still works as before.

🧪 New `tests/test_install_release.sh` covers both paths: (a) when the requested version can't be fetched, no bogus symlink is left behind; (b) the self-install bootstrap still succeeds and writes metadata.

**Upgrade note:** users whose cache contains symlinked version dirs (e.g. `v1.14.0 -> v1.8.0`) should delete the broken entry and reinstall: `rm ~/.octopus-cli/cache/v1.14.0 && curl -fsSL https://github.com/leocosta/octopus/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s -- --version v1.14.0 --force`. Once on v1.14.1, the bug can't recur.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-20

🧭 Task routing matrix (RM-034) lands as a canonical markdown fragment at `skills/_shared/task-routing.md`, embedded byte-identically in the three starter workflow skills (`implement`, `debugging`, `receiving-code-review`). Four signal categories — Stack/language (paths, stack traces), Domain-audit (billing keywords, multi-tenant queries, cross-stack diffs, secrets), Cross-workflow (feature vs. bug vs. review handoffs), Risk-profile (large-scale change, migration, release) — map observable task signals to the companion skills worth consulting. Graceful degradation: when a companion skill isn't installed, the main workflow continues and surfaces a one-line hint rather than blocking.

🔄 Replaces the RM-034 stub paragraph in all three skills; the `## Task Routing` heading stays in place, so the section-level structural tests are unaffected. Per-skill tests (`test_implement.sh`, `test_debugging.sh`, `test_receiving_code_review.sh`) now check for the `<!-- BEGIN task-routing -->` marker instead of the `RM-034` placeholder string.

🧪 New `tests/test_task_routing.sh` enforces byte-identical sync between the canonical fragment and the three SKILL.md embeds via `awk` block extraction and `diff`, so any future drift fails CI with a 20-line diff preview. `skills/_shared/` is deliberately outside the `skills/*/SKILL.md` discovery glob, so the fragment is an authoring-only artifact — never delivered as a skill.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-20

🔒 New destructive-action guard hook intercepts dangerous Bash commands before the agent runs them. `hooks/pre-tool-use/destructive-guard.sh` is a PreToolUse/Bash hook that matches a curated blocklist (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git clean -f`, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `TRUNCATE`, `DELETE FROM` without `WHERE`, `chmod -R 777`, `find ... -delete`, `npm uninstall -g`, `curl | bash`) and blocks with exit code 2 plus a stderr message that explains the rule and how to bypass. The bypass is a `# destructive-guard-ok: <reason>` marker in the command text itself — the reason must be non-empty and surfaces in command history and code review, so the override is visible rather than silent. A legitimate `DELETE FROM t WHERE expired < now();` is not blocked; the guard only trips when the WHERE clause is absent.

🔧 Integration with the existing Octopus hooks pipeline: the script ships in `hooks/pre-tool-use/`, registers in `hooks/hooks.json` under `PreToolUse`/`Bash`, and is delivered automatically by the installer's `deliver_hooks` when `hooks: true` is set in `.octopus.yml` (the default for the `quality-gates` bundle and common in `starter`). Opt-out via a new manifest field `destructiveGuard: false`, which routes through the existing `OCTOPUS_DISABLED_HOOKS` filter so the hook is absent from the rendered `settings.json` without disabling the rest of the hooks layer. Claude Code sees exit code 2 as "block this tool call and surface the message to the model", so the agent gets the block reason and can retry with a justified marker.

🐛 Also fixes a pre-existing bug in the `deliver_hooks` python filter: the previous code compared `id` at the matcher-entry level when `id` actually lives one level deeper (inside each entry's `hooks` array). The filter never removed anything. Now filters at both levels and drops matcher entries whose `hooks` array becomes empty. The `OCTOPUS_DISABLED_HOOKS` env var therefore works as documented for the first time.

📝 Ships with tutorial at `docs/features/destructive-action-guard.md`, new row in `docs/features/hooks.md`, `destructiveGuard:` entry added to the README `.octopus.yml` snippet, roadmap transition (RM-033 moves to Completed), and a 7-test structural suite covering script existence + executability, 14 destructive patterns each blocked, 5 safe commands each pass, non-Bash payloads exit 0, exit code 2 on blocks, hooks.json registration, and the injection + opt-out behavior through the full `deliver_hooks` path.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `receiving-code-review` skill codifies the PR-feedback discipline — verify the critique against the code, ask for evidence on generic comments, separate reasoned feedback from preference, never make performative changes, ask for clarification on ambiguity. Active by default on every PR feedback loop, the skill joins the `starter` foundation bundle as the third workflow skill alongside `implement` (features) and `debugging` (bugs). The starter bundle now covers the three common working states: writing new code, fixing broken code, responding to feedback on code. Rule 1 requires reading the code the reviewer pointed at before accepting the critique — a reviewer who is wrong wants to know, not to be agreed with. Rule 2 refuses to infer the intent of generic comments ("this is ugly") — ask for specificity. Rule 3 separates technical reasoning from personal preference and negotiates preference honestly rather than treating it as an instruction. Rule 4 forbids changing code just to close a thread without understanding the concern. Rule 5 asks for clarification when a comment allows multiple readings.

🎨 Stack-neutral by design. The skill describes discipline, not a specific review tool or platform. When the `superpowers:*` plugin is installed, `superpowers:receiving-code-review` wins per rule on the practices it already covers; this skill still owns Octopus-native integration with `/octopus:pr-comments` and the handoffs to `implement` and `debugging`. Section `## Task Routing` reserves the same extension hook RM-034 will wire into all three starter-workflow skills.

📝 Ships with tutorial at `docs/features/receiving-code-review.md`, wizard registration, README + skills.md updates, roadmap transition (RM-032 moves to Completed), and 9 structural tests. `tests/test_bundles.sh` bumps to reflect the starter bundle growing to 6 skills (Test 5) and the full bundle expansion reaching 11 skills (Test 9).

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `debugging` skill codifies the universal bug-fix workflow — reproduce deterministically, isolate, fix with a regression test first, document non-obvious cause. Active by default on every bug-triage task, the skill joins the `starter` foundation bundle alongside `implement`, so every repo running `octopus setup` now has symmetric coverage: `implement` for features, `debugging` for bugs. The body documents four phases in a fixed order. Phase 1 requires a deterministic reproduction before proposing a cause — "works on my machine" and "sometimes happens" are symptoms of missing context. Phase 2 isolates via `git bisect` (for regressions) or hypothesis → test → refute (for everything else); logs confirm hypotheses but do not substitute for isolation. Phase 3 writes the failing regression test before the fix, reusing `implement`'s TDD loop with the red step sourced from the bug. Phase 4 documents non-obvious causes in the commit message, an ADR, or a `continuous-learning` entry, so the same bug does not recur under a different symptom months later.

🎨 Stack-neutral by design. The skill describes a protocol, not specific debuggers or languages. When the `superpowers:*` plugin is installed, `superpowers:systematic-debugging` wins per phase on the practices it already covers; `debugging` still owns Phase 4 (Octopus-native integration with `continuous-learning` and ADRs). Section `## Task Routing` reserves the same extension hook RM-034 will wire into `implement`, so both skills share one routing edit when RM-034 lands.

📝 Ships with tutorial at `docs/features/debugging.md`, wizard registration, README + skills.md updates, roadmap transition (RM-031 moves to Completed), and 9 structural tests covering frontmatter, all six required sections, the four phase headers, Task Routing mentioning RM-034, Anti-Patterns naming core violations, slash command, bundle membership, wizard wiring, and tutorial presence. `tests/test_bundles.sh` bumps to reflect the starter bundle growing to 5 skills (Test 5 fixture) and the full bundle expansion reaching 10 skills (Test 9).

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `implement` skill codifies the universal implementation workflow. Active by default on every code-editing task — the skill joins the `starter` foundation bundle so every repo running `octopus setup` picks it up automatically. The body documents five practices in a fixed order: (1) TDD loop (red → green → refactor → commit for observable behavior); (2) plan-before-code gate (present a short plan on tasks touching > 2 files or with ambiguous approach); (3) verification-before-completion (run the project's test/typecheck/format and attach output before declaring work done); (4) simplify pass (re-read changed code with the simplifier lens before committing); (5) commit cadence (one commit per logical step, hooks must pass, never `--no-verify`).

🎨 Stack-neutral by design. The skill does not duplicate `rules/common/*` (static rules) or compete with language-specific skills (`dotnet`, `backend-patterns`, `e2e-testing`). When the user has the `superpowers:*` plugin installed, composition rule is "the more specific skill wins per practice" — superpowers drives TDD / systematic debugging / verification when active; `implement` fills the other gaps. Section `## Task Routing` reserves an extension hook for RM-034, which will auto-dispatch to the right sub-skill or role per task (backend / frontend / infra / data / refactor / bug).

📝 Ships with tutorial at `docs/features/implement.md`, wizard registration, README + skills.md updates, roadmap transition (RM-030 moves to Completed), and 9 structural tests covering frontmatter, all six required sections, the five practice headers, Task Routing mentioning RM-034, Anti-Patterns naming core violations, slash command, bundle membership, wizard wiring, and tutorial presence.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `audit-all` composer skill runs `security-scan`, `money-review`, `tenant-scope-audit`, and `cross-stack-contract` in parallel against one ref with shared file discovery and a consolidated severity report. Instead of four sequential invocations (each duplicating ref resolution, diff computation, file classification), `audit-all` does the discovery work once, partitions touched files by domain (money / tenant / webhook / auth / api-contract / frontend-consumer / secrets / config), dispatches four subagents via `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`, then merges the four reports into one output with a **cross-audit hotspots table** — files flagged by ≥ 2 audits surface at the top for triage. Every sub-report keeps its own `🚫/⚠/ℹ + confidence` footer so reviewers can paste an audit's section into a PR thread.

🔧 New `depends_on:` skill-frontmatter mechanism. A skill can declare `depends_on: [skill-a, skill-b]` in its frontmatter; `expand_bundles()` walks the list after bundle expansion, pulls each dependency, loops until stable, warns on missing deps, aborts on cycles or excessive depth (5 passes). This lets `audit-all` declare its four audit dependencies in one place — `bundles/quality-gates.yml` now lists only `audit-all`, the four individual audits arrive automatically. Individual audits remain first-class and invocable directly via `/octopus:security-scan`, `/octopus:money-review`, etc.

🎨 Graceful degradation: `audit-all` adapts to what's installed. A missing dependency skips that audit with a warning; the summary line reports "{N} of 4 audits ran; install {list} to enable the rest". When `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` is unavailable (non-Claude-Code agents), execution falls back to sequential with a one-line notice; output shape is identical. v1 always exits 0 (guidance, not gate).

📝 Ships with tutorial at `docs/features/audit-all.md`, updates to README / skills.md / bundles.md tables, closes RM-028 in the roadmap. 13 structural tests (7 for the skill itself + 4 new `depends_on` scenarios in `test_bundles.sh` covering happy path, missing-dep warning, cycle detection, no-deps skills).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-19

📝 Every slash-command tutorial heading now shows the fully-qualified `/octopus:<name>` form. Before, the level-1 heading in `commands/*.md` rendered as `# /<name>`, which made the `octopus:` namespace look like a typo to new users who saw only the tutorial. Fixed across all 10 user-invoked commands: `cross-stack-contract`, `doc-adr`, `doc-research`, `doc-rfc`, `doc-spec`, `feature-to-market`, `money-review`, `plan-backlog-hygiene`, `release-announce`, `tenant-scope-audit`.

🐛 `docs/features/bundles.md` also gains `release-announce` in the `growth` bundle row — v1.8.0 added the skill to the bundle YAML but the tutorial table missed it, so readers browsing the bundle catalog thought `growth` still shipped only `feature-to-market`.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-19

🐛 `install.sh` reused any existing `cache/v<version>/` directory without verifying its contents — so a dir created by an aborted download, a manually-copied staging snapshot, or an older installer that packaged stale content under a newer label would be silently reused. Result: the `current` symlink pointed at a directory labeled `v1.8.0` that actually shipped v1.5.0 code, leading to `octopus setup` regenerating `.claude/settings.json` with the pre-v1.5.1 bugs (relative hook paths, invalid `PostToolUseFailure` event, unsupported top-level keys). Fix: on successful extraction the installer now writes the verified tarball SHA256 to `<cache-dir>/.cache-sha256` as an integrity marker. On subsequent runs, when the cache dir exists, the installer fetches the release's checksum file and compares it against the marker; mismatch or missing marker triggers a fresh re-extract, while a match reuses the cache. When no checksum endpoint is available (offline install or custom mirror), the installer falls back to the legacy "dir exists → reuse" behavior so offline flows keep working. `--force` continues to unconditionally re-download.

🧪 `tests/test_installer.sh` gains four assertions covering the full contract: marker is written after a fresh extract, a corrupted cache is purged and re-extracted on the next run (detected via a canary file that survives only if the dir was NOT wiped), a healthy cache is reused without redundant download, and `--force` always re-downloads even when the cache is healthy.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `release-announce` skill turns one or more refs (tags, tag ranges, RM IDs) into a themed release announcement kit aimed at **existing users** — a distinct job from `feature-to-market`, which handles acquisition and external audiences. Inputs can be a single version (`v1.7.0`), a range (`v1.5.0..v1.7.0`), or an RM ID (`RM-008`); default is since the last tagged release. Output is two-tiered: **canonical artifacts** (`index.html` themed landing page, `notes.md` plain fallback, `theme.yml` snapshot for reproducibility) plus **paste-ready channel messages** under `channels/` for email, Slack, Discord, in-app banner, status page, X/Twitter thread, WhatsApp, and an autocontained slide deck with keyboard nav and print-to-PDF.

🎨 Nine preset themes ship in v1 — `classic` (neutral newsletter default), `jade` (calm green), `dark` (modern high-contrast), `bold` (vibrant with oversized display), `newsletter` (text-heavy serif), `sunset` (warm orange/pink), `ocean` (cool blues), `terminal` (green mono-on-black dev aesthetic), and `paper` (editorial cream/browns). Each theme is a YAML file declaring palette, typography, layout (hero / grouping / density), and voice (tone / persona) tokens. Users pick via `.octopus.yml theme:` or per-run `--theme=<name>`. `--channels=<list>` controls the channel subset; default `email,slack,in-app-banner`. `--audience=<user|developer|executive>` tunes copy voice.

🔧 `--design-from="<prompt>"` optionally invokes the `frontend-design` skill to synthesize a custom theme YAML on the fly (e.g. `--design-from="retro arcade synthwave"`). The generated theme is persisted to `docs/release-announce/themes/<slug>.yml` and reusable via `--theme=<slug>` in subsequent runs. Default path stays deterministic — `frontend-design` is invoked only via `--design-from`, never for plain rendering.

📝 Slides template ships with ≤40 lines of vanilla JS (keyboard `→`/`←`/`Space`/`PageUp`/`PageDown`, touch swipe, URL hash persistence, print-to-PDF via `@page` landscape), inline CSS, no external assets. Email template uses bulletproof patterns (inline CSS, `<table>` layout, no `<script>`/`<style>` in body). The skill joins the `growth` bundle next to `feature-to-market`, covers acquisition + retention in one bundle. 12 structural tests guard skill content, theme shape, template tokens, slides JS budget, and wizard / bundle / README / skills.md integration.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ Introduces **bundles** as the primary setup path. The wizard's Quick mode (default) now asks 4–6 yes/no persona questions ("Is this a SaaS product for external customers?", "Does your team produce marketing content?", "Primary backend is .NET?") and maps each positive answer to a curated bundle of skills + roles + rules. Seven bundles ship in v1: `starter` (foundation — `adr`, `feature-lifecycle`, `context-budget`; always included), four intent bundles (`quality-gates` → security-scan + money-review + tenant-scope-audit + backend-specialist role; `growth` → feature-to-market + social-media role; `docs-discipline` → plan-backlog-hygiene + continuous-learning + tech-writer role; `cross-stack` → cross-stack-contract + backend + frontend specialists), and two stack bundles (`dotnet-api`, `node-api`). Users can declare `bundles: [...]` in `.octopus.yml` and the expansion happens at setup time — a new user never needs to memorize the 13-skill catalog to get a sensible config. Power users still pick Full mode or mix explicit `skills:` / `roles:` on top of bundles; all user-explicit entries are additive (bundles never remove selections).

🔧 Implementation: new `OCTOPUS_BUNDLES` array parsed by `parse_octopus_yml`, `_load_bundle` reads a single YAML via python3, `expand_bundles` unions components across bundles with `_dedupe_array` preserving first-seen order. The expansion runs before any delivery function, so `deliver_skills` / `deliver_roles` / `deliver_mcp` stay oblivious to bundles — the feature is purely a preprocessing layer. New `_wizard_sub_bundles()` reads each bundle's `persona_question` and asks y/n; the Quick-mode flow now takes three grouped steps (Agents → Bundles → Workflow) instead of a one-shot 3-question form. The manifest writer emits `bundles:` when the wizard picked any, and skips emitting expanded `skills:` / `roles:` lists in that case.

📝 Docs: new `docs/features/bundles.md` tutorial covers Enable / Combining / Authoring / the new-skill convention. `docs/features/skills.md` gains a Bundle column showing membership for every skill. README intro, Quick Start, and Features table all surface bundles as the primary path. `templates/spec.md` gains a required `Bundle:` field in the "Context for Agents" section, enforcing the convention that every future skill declares bundle membership in its spec — no loose skills drift into the catalog without users discovering them.

🧪 New `tests/test_bundles.sh` runs nine assertions: bundle metadata presence, persona-question coverage for intent/stack, parser recognizes `bundles:`, loader populates component arrays, unknown bundle aborts loudly, union across multiple bundles, de-duplication of overlapping contributions, preservation of user-explicit entries, and full manifest round-trip (bundles-only YAML expands to the expected 6 skills + roles).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `tenant-scope-audit` skill catches the systemic data-leak risk in multi-tenant SaaS codebases: a query without a tenant filter returns rows from every tenant. Given a branch or PR, the skill resolves the diff against a base, reads the optional `.octopus.yml` `tenantScope:` config (fields `field` / `filter` / `context` / `entities`, with defaults `TenantId` / `AppQueryFilter` / `AppDbContext`), identifies tenant-relevant files via path tokens (`Controller`, `Service`, `DbContext`, `Queries`, …) and content heuristics, and runs six inspection checks. T1 (`query-without-filter`) blocks on `IgnoreQueryFilters()` calls without a preceding `// tenant-override: <reason>` marker; T2 (`dbcontext-missing-filter`) blocks on new `DbSet<X>` entries lacking `HasQueryFilter` configuration; T3 (`raw-sql-no-filter`) blocks on `FromSqlRaw` / `ExecuteSqlRaw` / `Database.SqlQuery` whose SQL literal does not restrict by the tenant field. T4 (`id-from-route-no-ownership`) warns when a controller action accepts an id from the route and calls `.FindAsync(id)` on a tenant-scoped DbSet without a known ownership helper; T5 (`join-to-unfiltered-table`) warns on LINQ joins into a global table without tenant restriction; T6 (`cross-tenant-admin-endpoint`) warns on `[AllowAnonymous]` / `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` methods that touch tenant-scoped data without a `// across-tenants: <reason>` marker.

🎨 Every finding carries a `confidence` label (`high` / `medium` / `low`) for triage parity with `cross-stack-contract`. The report format matches the existing `money-review` / `cross-stack-contract` / `security-scan` output (`🚫 Block / ⚠ Warn / ℹ Info`) plus a one-line config trailer showing which tenant field / filter / context were in effect. `--write-report` persists to `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-tenant-<slug>.md`; `--only=<checks>` runs a subset; `--base=<branch>` overrides the default `main`.

📝 Ships with default regex tokens for EF raw-SQL helpers, admin role markers, and override-marker comment grammar. Override cascade at `docs/tenant-scope-audit/patterns.md`. Tutorial at `docs/features/tenant-scope-audit.md` documents the `tenant-override:` and `across-tenants:` comment contracts. 8 structural tests, wizard + README + `skills.md` descriptions-table row integration. All four audit skills (`security-scan`, `money-review`, `cross-stack-contract`, `tenant-scope-audit`) now share one output format, so a combined PR comment concatenates without extra formatting.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-19

🐛 Three bugs in `.claude/settings.json` generation that could prevent Claude Code from loading the file. First, hook commands were emitted as relative paths (`octopus/hooks/pre-tool-use/block-no-verify.sh`) that do not resolve from the project's working directory — Claude Code would try to run a non-existent script. `deliver_hooks` in `setup.sh` now rewrites the `octopus/hooks/` prefix to the absolute Octopus install root (`$OCTOPUS_DIR/hooks/`), so every hook command is an absolute path that executes regardless of CWD. Second, `hooks/hooks.json` shipped a `PostToolUseFailure` event that is not part of Claude Code's documented hook schema; its presence could invalidate the settings.json on strict validation. The event and its companion `mcp-health` hook are removed. Third, `deliver_boris_settings` wrote experimental keys (`worktree`, `autoMemory`, `autoDream`, `sandbox`) at the top of settings.json plus `permissionMode: "auto"`, none of which are accepted values in Claude Code's schema. The function now whitelists only the schema-documented keys (`permissionMode`, `outputStyle`) and normalizes `permissionMode=auto` to `default`. The related features still ship (the dream subagent is delivered as a Claude agent file, the batch skill is an independent skill, etc.) — they just do not pollute `settings.json` with unrecognized keys.

🧪 New `tests/test_hooks_injection.sh` guards the three invariants: every hook command starts with `/`, no invalid events land in `settings.json`, and Boris-tip passthroughs are filtered + normalized correctly.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `plan-backlog-hygiene` skill keeps the planning surface honest over time. Repos that lean on the feature-lifecycle accumulate plans, specs, and research docs faster than teams archive them — Tatame's `plans/` has grown past 50 files. The skill walks the planning directory (autodetected as `plans/`, `docs/plans/`, or `docs/superpowers/plans/`, or overridden via the new `.octopus.yml` `plansDir:` field), parses `docs/roadmap.md`, and cross-references the two. Six hygiene checks land in v1: orphan plans with no RM/PR/issue/spec reference (H1, Info), plans for already-completed RMs still sitting outside `archive/` (H2, Warn — auto-fixable), duplicate plans for the same RM-NNN (H3, Warn), broken internal links to missing specs/research/ADRs (H4, Warn), roadmap RMs in progress without a matching plan file (H5, Info), and plans unchanged longer than `--stale-days` (H6, Info, default 90).

🔧 `--fix` applies a single reversible action: for H2 matches, move the plan to `<plansDir>/archive/YYYY-MM/<filename>` using `git mv` so history is preserved. The move is staged but not committed, so `git restore --staged` undoes cleanly. A clean working tree is required. Other checks are never auto-fixed — H1/H3/H4/H5/H6 all need human judgment. `--write-report` persists the report to `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-hygiene.md`; `--only=<checks>` runs a subset; `--stale-days=<n>` tunes H6.

📝 Output format matches `money-review` and `cross-stack-contract` so a monthly "hygiene digest" PR can concatenate all three reports into one comment. Ships with default regex for RM/PR/issue/internal-link detection, roadmap status parsing (recognizes `completed`, `in progress`, `proposed`, `blocked`), an archive convention, tutorial at `docs/features/plan-backlog-hygiene.md`, 8 structural tests, and wizard + README integration. Pairs naturally with the `schedule` skill for monthly cron runs.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `cross-stack-contract` skill detects API-vs-frontend contract drift in multi-stack monorepos — the silent bugs that only surface at integration runtime when a DTO field renamed on the .NET side is never updated on the React or Astro twin. Given a branch or PR, the skill partitions the diff by stack (via `.octopus.yml` `stacks:` map or autodetection over `api/`, `apps/api/`, `backend/`, `server/` for the API and conventional paths for React/Vue/Angular and Astro/Next landing pages), extracts contract intent tokens from the API diff (endpoint paths, DTO/record names, enum names, route attributes, auth annotations, param lists), and grep-matches them against frontend usage. Seven drift classes land in v1: endpoint additions without a consumer (C1, Info), endpoint removals/renames still called by a frontend (C2, Block), DTO field drift (C3, Warn), enum member desync (C4, Warn), response status code changes (C5, Info), authorization rule changes (C6, Warn always), and path/query param shifts that break live call sites (C7, Warn).

🎨 Every finding carries a **confidence** label (`high`/`medium`/`low`) so reviewers can triage heuristic matches quickly. The output format is the same three-heading severity markdown emitted by `money-review` and `security-scan`, so three audits can be concatenated into a single PR comment without extra formatting work. `--write-report` persists the report to `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-contract-<slug>.md` with frontmatter listing the stacks compared and the summary counts. `--stacks=<list>` restricts the comparison; `--only=<checks>` runs a subset of C1–C7.

📝 Ships with default endpoint/DTO/consumer patterns for .NET (ASP.NET Controllers, Minimal API), Node (Express, Fastify, Hono, NestJS, Astro file routes), React / Vue / Angular / Astro frontends, and frontend consumer idioms (fetch/axios/ky, React Query/SWR, generated SDKs). Override cascade at `docs/cross-stack-contract/patterns.md`. Tutorial at `docs/features/cross-stack-contract.md`, 8 structural tests, wizard + README integration.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `money-review` skill audits money-touching code before merge. It resolves a branch or PR against a base, isolates money-touched files via filename and regex heuristics (tokens like `billing`, `payment`, `split`, `asaas`, `pix`, `webhook`, `fee`), and runs seven inspection families: numeric type safety (T1 — flag `float`/`double`/`number` for currency), explicit rounding strategy (T2), cents coverage in tests (T3 — require non-round literals like `0.01`, `199.99`), env-var consistency across sandbox and production (T4 — block when a new `*_PERCENT`/`*_FEE`/`*_RATE` exists in one environment but not the other), payment-call idempotency (T5 — flag POST calls lacking `Idempotency-Key` or `externalReference`), webhook signature verification (T6 — block new `/webhook` endpoints without a verifier helper), and fee/tax disclosure coupling (T7 — warn when a fee change lands without a spec mentioning disclosure).

🎨 Output is a severity-tiered markdown report (`🚫 Block / ⚠ Warn / ℹ Info`) designed to paste into a PR comment as-is. With `--write-report`, the same content is persisted to `docs/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-money-<slug>.md` with frontmatter for traceability. The `--only=<families>` flag restricts the scan to a subset; `--base=<branch>` overrides the default `main`.

📝 Ships with embedded default patterns (`skills/money-review/templates/patterns.md`), provider idioms for Asaas / Stripe / Mercado Pago (`templates/providers.md`), a three-level override cascade (`docs/money-review/patterns.md` → `docs/MONEY_REVIEW_PATTERNS.md` → embedded), a tutorial at `docs/features/money-review.md`, and 8 structural tests guarding skill / command / wizard integration. Composes with the existing `security-scan` skill — run both on any billing PR.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-19

✨ New `feature-to-market` skill turns a completed feature (RM-NNN, spec path, research path, or PR) into a versioned multi-channel launch kit under `docs/marketing/launches/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/`. The kit bundles Instagram, LinkedIn and X posts, a launch email, landing-page copy, a commercial changelog entry, and a 30–60s video script — each rendered from per-channel templates with placeholders populated from the resolved feature context. Invocation is a single slash command (`/octopus:feature-to-market <ref>`) with flags for channel selection, dry-run, forced angle, and regeneration. Brand and voice pull from a three-level override cascade: `docs/marketing/<name>.md` (canonical) → `docs/<NAME>.md` (uppercase compat with repos that already keep these files at the docs root) → embedded defaults shipped with the skill.

🎨 Optional image generation stays free by default: `GEMINI_API_KEY` (free tier at aistudio.google.com) is the preferred provider, with Pollinations.ai as a zero-setup fallback and graceful degradation to prompts-only when neither is available. Brand palette and logo constraints from `brand.md` are injected into every prompt; aspect ratios are pre-tuned per channel (1:1 IG, 1.91:1 LI, 16:9 X card, 16:9 LP hero).

📝 Tutorial lands at `docs/features/feature-to-market.md`, README skills list and the setup wizard (`cli/lib/setup-wizard.sh`) gain the new entry, and 13 structural tests guard file layout, frontmatter, documented sections, and wizard registration.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-18

🔧 Cleanup delivery closing RM-019, RM-020 and RM-021. `install.sh` no longer embeds a HEREDOC copy of the `bin/octopus` shim — the installer now copies the shim straight from the extracted release tree, removing 307 lines and eliminating the drift risk between the two sources. The release pipeline in `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` signs the published tarball with GPG and uploads `octopus-<tag>.tar.gz.asc` alongside the existing `.sha256`, closing the loop on RM-009's consumer-side verification (requires `OCTOPUS_RELEASE_GPG_KEY` and `OCTOPUS_RELEASE_GPG_PASSPHRASE` to be provisioned as repo secrets — see `docs/specs/release-signing-pipeline.md`).

🧪 Four tests that had been waved through as "pre-existing failures" since before v1.0.0 are now fixed. They referenced functions renamed during earlier refactors (`generate_claude`, `inject_mcp_servers`), missed a pipeline step (`collect_gitignore_entries`), or used assertions that the current delivery contract outgrew. The full test suite now reports **19/19 green** on a clean checkout.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-18

Consolidated delivery of RM-011 through RM-018.

✨ Seven new manifest fields expose Boris Cherny's Claude Code tips as first-class Octopus configuration. `worktree`, `memory`, `dream`, `sandbox` and `permissionMode`/`outputStyle` flow through to `.claude/settings.json` as passthroughs. `githubAction: true` idempotently scaffolds `.github/workflows/claude.yml` for automated PR review. The new `batch` skill documents a fan-out pattern for applying the same prompt across many targets in isolated git worktrees, and a `dream` subagent (Haiku, Read/Write only) ships to consolidate and prune stale memory entries.

✨ Install scopes land as RM-018. A new `--scope=repo|user` flag (plus `OCTOPUS_SCOPE` env var, `scope:` manifest field, and a wizard pre-flight question) lets teams install a shared base configuration at `~/.claude/` and layer per-repo overrides on top — every agent already merges user-level with project-level config at read time. User-scope manifests live at `~/.config/octopus/.octopus.yml` following XDG; secrets go to `~/.config/octopus/.env.octopus` with `chmod 600`. Fields that don't make sense at user scope (`mcp`, `workflow`, `reviewers`, `githubAction`, `knowledge`) warn and are ignored; `.gitignore` updates and CI scaffolds are skipped.

🎨 The setup wizard was reorganized from 12 sequential steps into 5 grouped steps (Basics, What the AI knows and does, Integrations, Team workflow, Advanced Claude settings) with sub-question headers inside each group. A new pre-flight Quick/Full mode lets users opt for a 3-question fast path or walk the full flow. Reconfigure mode suppresses long descriptions and hints unless `OCTOPUS_WIZARD_VERBOSE=1`. The Advanced step is skipped entirely when Claude is not in the agent list.

📝 Eight new specs document the delivery: worktree-isolation, auto-mode, memory-dream, sandbox, output-styles, github-action, batch-skill, install-scopes. Roadmap reconciled with RM-011 through RM-018 in Completed.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-18

Marks the first stable release, consolidating RM-005 through RM-009 in a single delivery.

✨ The global CLI installer now verifies detached GPG signatures alongside the existing SHA256 check — configurable via `OCTOPUS_GPG_KEYRING`, `OCTOPUS_GPG_IMPORT_KEY`, `OCTOPUS_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE`, and `OCTOPUS_SKIP_SIGNATURE`, closing the remaining supply-chain gap on compromised mirrors. Installer hardening continues with new `--bin-dir` / `--cache-root` flags, `OCTOPUS_INSTALL_ENDPOINT` support for `file://` mirrors, and real SHA256 capture in `metadata.json`.

✨ Setup UX was unified across `install.sh`, the interactive wizard, and `setup.sh`. A new `cli/lib/ui.sh` module provides shared vocabulary that groups per-agent delivery under a single step line. Every wizard prompt now dispatches to the active TUI backend (fzf / whiptail / dialog / bash), and each of the eleven wizard steps gained a contextual explanation plus per-item hints.

📝 Role templates can now declare a `tools:` frontmatter field that is preserved for Claude Code and stripped for every other target. Language rules specs were promoted to Implemented alongside the behavioral detection rule and the project-override mechanism.

⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: submodule mode is no longer supported. `cli/lib/update.sh`, `commands/update.md`, `tests/test_update.sh`, the submodule branch in `setup.sh` PROJECT_ROOT resolution, `OCTOPUS_CLI_REL`, and every submodule/legacy-shim reference across README, commands, and feature docs were removed. Existing submodule installs must switch to the global CLI (`install.sh`) and re-run `octopus setup`; the manifest is preserved. RM-010 (`octopus migrate` helper) was rejected as a consequence.

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-06
Fixed a syntax error in the _select_one bash fallback function that was causing issues in the setup process. 🐛

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-06
Added an interactive TUI setup wizard (`octopus setup`) that guides users through configuring `.octopus.yml` with multi-backend support (fzf/whiptail/dialog/bash) and full Windows/Git Bash compatibility. ✨

## [0.15.10] - 2026-04-05
Fixed the CLI setup for PROJECT_ROOT and added interactive scaffolding features. 🐛

## [0.15.9] - 2026-04-05
Fixed the CLI setup command by adding the missing setup command to cli/octopus.sh 🐛

## [0.15.8] - 2026-04-05
Added contents: write permission for GitHub release upload in CI workflow. 🐛

## [0.15.7] - 2026-04-05
Fixed a CI issue where the tar archive was causing self-modification errors by writing it to /tmp instead. 🐛

## [0.15.6] - 2026-04-05
🐛 Replaced softprops action with gh CLI and upgraded checkout to v6 in CI workflows.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-04-05
🔁 Set `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true` on the release job so all JavaScript actions (including `actions/checkout@v4`) run under Node.js 24. The `v4.x` line bundles Node.js 20 internally regardless of the pinned version tag, causing a deprecation warning that surfaced as a runtime failure on the updated GitHub runners.
